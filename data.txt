Abstract:	Pregnancies complicated by obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes are more common than ever, but effects of complications on the offspring are poorly described. This research program will a) determine how complicated pregnancies influence the health of the offspring by examining longitudinal data from three studies and b) determine whether lifestyle interventions for women who experience complicated pregnancies improve health outcomes of the offspring.

Abstract:	Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults. Early detection and treatment of DR can reduce blindness by 90%, but underserved populations with poor access to screening and eye care have disproportionately high rates of blindness. This study aims to implement and evaluate an innovative technology-based blindness prevention program for underserved populations. Providing early diagnosis will reduce rates of blindness from DR.

Abstract:	Diabetes-related distress, the negative emotional impact of living with diabetes (DM), is a powerful predictor of psychosocial functioning, treatment adherence, and glycemic control. Practice guidelines and consensus statements call for innovative approaches to address DM-related distress. Despite availability of self-management and psychosocial interventions to reduce DM-related distress, these interventions are underutilized due to constraints in time, finances, motivation, and resource awareness. Interventions that leverage traditional medical care and community-based health promotion programs (e.g., DM self-management education [DSME] programs) may enhance the ability of veterans with DM to engage with a broad and accessible range of resources. Ensuring that veterans with DM receive adequate self-care support requires interventions that (1) attend to both medical care and diabetes-related distress and (2) improve veterans' access and engagement with DSME and traditional medical/mental care. Integrating Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and community health services and DSME resources is innovative and affords great opportunities to enhance veteran outcomes and build VA community partnerships. Engagement of veterans and community organizations in developing and delivering care responds to the 2016 Health Services Research and Development Service (HSR&D) high-priority domain of Health Care Systems Change and aligns with the 2017 VA Under Secretary's priorities of greater choice (offering community and VA resources), efficiency (community and VA coordination), and timeliness (telephone delivery). This community-VA partnership and three-month veteran peer coaching intervention (iNSPiRED) aims to enhance psychological wellbeing and diabetes self-management behavior in veterans with DM by facilitating access to and use of health care and health promotion resources. The intervention focuses on reducing cognitive and practical barriers to use of services by engaging veteran peers as coaches and navigators, and by encouraging engagement in health promotion and health care services in the VA and the greater community. A secondary goal, integral to the main goal, is to strengthen and integrate Veterans Health Administration (VHA) partnerships with community-based organizations and veteran support organizations (VSOs). This is a single-blind, parallel group randomized trial of a 3-month peer navigation intervention for veterans with DM and elevated levels of DM-related distress. We will recruit veterans with DM-related distress through existing help seeking channels within and outside of the VA in partnership with community agencies, veteran service organizations (VSOs), and the Houston VA Medical Center (VAMC). Eligible veterans will be assigned at random to the iNSPiRED intervention (peer navigation and coaching) versus usual care (written resource materials and encouragement to continue follow-up with health care providers). Consistent with the focus on the overall emotional impact of DM, the primary outcome is DM-related distress (DM Distress Scale [DDS]). In previous studies the DDS has shown strong relationships with psychological symptoms, self-management behaviors, and objective measures of glycemic control. Secondary outcomes include anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale), depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-8), DM self-management behaviors (DM Self-Management Scale), and self-reported use and new use of VA or community resources. In addition to participant-level outcomes, we will also assess stakeholder outcomes through a mixed-methods process evaluation. Our objective will be to measure the impact of stakeholder engagement activities on development and sustainability of VA-community partnerships, trust and communication, and capacity building. Assessment of primary and secondary endpoints will occur at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6 months. If this project meets intended goals, we will partner with VHA Office of Community Engagement and VHA Specialty Care to implement the intervention for DM and other chronic diseases.

Abstract:	A substantial number of patients develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) during their lifetime and need diabetes medications. However, poor glycemic control (hypo- [low] and hyper- [high] glycemia or blood sugar) from unsafe medication use is known to contribute to both complications and mortality. Therefore, assuring DM patients' ability to appropriately manage glycemic control after high-risk times, such as hospital discharge, is critical. In a prior study, we identified high-risk failures in the discharge process of patients with DM, including variability in comprehension and standardization of diabetes education. To address these failures, we developed a Diabetes Discharge Toolkit, a hands-on teaching kit for patients and providers with an integrated website and app for both inpatient and outpatient use, utilizing a user-centered design approach. The goal of this proposal is to integrate and implement the Diabetes Discharge Toolkit to improve the quality and safety of the transition of DM care from hospital to home for patients newly prescribed insulin. We will then assess the adequacy of implementation to ensure appropriate fidelity of the proposed intervention in this transitional care setting. Following, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the intervention to test the efficacy of the toolkit and to assess its impact on reducing hyper- and hypoglycemia, following hospital discharge. We then propose to disseminate our findings for future use of the toolkit throughout our institution and at the local level through a local collaboration with our diabetes association. There is a clear need for improvement in DM transitions of care, and improvement in the safe use of DM medications, given that they are a high-risk population. This intervention has the potential to be generalized to DM care in other care settings (e.g., emergency department, outpatient clinic) for DM patients.

Abstract:	What research finding is this project disseminating or implementing? With funding from Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), we implemented the largest pragmatic trial to date of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in primary care patients with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes mellitus (NIT T2DM) in the US. Among 450 adults over the age of 30 with NIT T2DM drawn from 15 North Carolina primary-care practices, the MONITOR Trial examined whether SMBG impacts A1c, health-related quality of life, or key adverse events, such as hypoglycemic frequency, health care utilization, and insulin initiation. Patients were randomly assigned to three trial arms: no SMBG, once-daily SMBG, and once-daily SMBG with enhanced patient feedback, including automatic tailored messages delivered via the glucose meter. We found no clinically or statistically significant differences at 1 year in A1c between patients with NIT T2DM who performed SMBG and those who did not. Similarly, no differences were found for health-related quality of life or key adverse events. In short, this large, targeted, randomized study found no evidence that SMBG, even when enhanced with messaging, leads to improvements in key outcomes. Based on our findings, we propose to disseminate and implement a multicomponent de-adoption strategy targeted at primary care practices, health care providers, patients, and payers. Why is this research finding important? Ours and others' research shows that SMBG is a low-value test that should not be routine for patients with NIT T2DM. De-adoption of SMBG can minimize the associated costs, both monetary and personal, of SMBG overtreatment. De-adoption may also provide more time and resources for clinicians and patients to focus on treatments with more proven effectiveness for NIT T2DM. Successful de-adoption can positively affect end-users by helping primary care clinicians and patients make more patient-centered decisions that reflect their preferences, needs, and values. What is the goal of the dissemination and implementation (D&I) project? The program, titled Rethink the Strip, delivers a multicomponent de-adoption strategy to primary care practices, health care providers, patients, and payers. The primary objective is to engage a broad group of stakeholders to implement a patient-centered approach to the de-adoption of SMBG among NIT T2DM patients (aim 1). Using a repeated measures design, we will evaluate the effectiveness and impact of Rethink the Strip (aim 2). Using lessons learned, we will finalize and package Rethink the Strip for nationwide dissemination (aim 3). What is the project team doing? We will work with six external change agents to implement five intervention components at 20 sites. We selected components from existing taxonomies of implementation strategies that target the multilevel factors influencing SMBG and have the strongest evidence base for effectiveness. The final Rethink the Strip de-adoption strategy includes three practice components delivered directly to the practices (practice facilitation, audit and feedback, practice champions) and two directed to the health system generally (educational meetings, print and electronic materials). In our two-phase roll-out, we will implement the first three components in three practices for six months (phase 1). Following stakeholder input and discussion of phase 1 results, we will refine the intervention and conduct the full roll-out to the remaining 17 sites for 18 months (phase 2). We will then finalize Rethink the Strip for broad-scale distribution. The final kit of successful strategies used in this proposal is expected to include the steps used for the audit and feedback approach, practice facilitation approaches, methods for engaging stakeholders, and materials and handouts used. How will the project team evaluate its D&I activities? Our evaluation will use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) evaluation framework, assessing adoption by primary care practices, providers, and care managers; implementation fidelity; and patient reach. The process evaluation will also indirectly assess the potential reach of Rethink the Strip through its effects on participating practices and their providers (outcomes). Formal outcome evaluation will assess the intervention's impact on providers' knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy, and the prescription of test strips. Reach: We will use counts of the number of providers and diabetes educators attending educational and practice facilitator sessions, as well as NIT T2DM patients per practice who present for visits with their health care provider. Effectiveness: We will survey providers and diabetes educators on knowledge and attitudes about SMBG de-adoption. Test strip prescription levels will be assessed at baseline and every three months for 18 months. Adoption: We will examine characteristics of providers who did and did not reduce test strip prescribing, practices agreeing versus declining to participate, and providers who do and do not participate in educational sessions. We will also meet with Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) care managers to assess attendance rates and discussion of de-adoption. Implementation: Fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability of Rethink the Strip will be evaluated via attendance logs, provider surveys, and provider/patient/diabetes educator interviews and focus groups. Brief providers surveys will be administered after each educational meeting. We will also conduct semi-structured interviews with 20 NIT T2DM patients exposed to Rethink the Strip, asking about any educational materials they received or discussions they held with their doctors. We will also conduct five focus groups with providers and one focus group with diabetes educators, discussing the usefulness of the educational materials and reactions to/experiences with Rethink the Strip. Maintenance: In addition to our maintenance-related primary outcome of test strip prescriptions at 18 months, we will include interview, survey, and focus group questions on the likelihood of maintaining de-adoption. How is the project team involving patients and others in this D&I project? The stakeholder team that was involved in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the original MONITOR Trial will also be involved in this next phase. The team includes representatives from the North Carolina Diabetes Advisory Council, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) Family Medicine Patient Advisory Board, UNC Physicians Network, the American Diabetes Association, the National Diabetes Education Program/diabetes educator, and patient stakeholders. For this study, we are adding the North Carolina Blue Cross Blue Shield and a neighboring health system. In accordance with the PCORI engagement rubric, we will follow the principles of reciprocal relationships, co-learning, partnerships, transparency, honesty, and trust. Our stakeholders were instrumental in formulating research questions, defining essential characteristics of study participants, comparators, and outcomes; monitoring study conduct and progress; and disseminating results. We will continue our stakeholder meetings on a quarterly basis and more often as needed. Stakeholder input will be especially key between the two aim 1 phases and during the final compilation of Rethink the Strip materials. How will this project help ensure future uptake and use of PCORI results? Based on the costs of SMBG and its demonstrated lack of utility, plus the degree of stakeholder input and involvement in this project, we believe our Rethink the Strip strategy has high potential for sustainability. We plan to package our strategy for broad-scale dissemination. Distribution will be aided significantly by our strong stakeholder buy-in and partnerships. Our public health stakeholders have ties to health department directors and diabetes educators and have mechanisms for dissemination through these groups. Our community stakeholders have mechanisms to disseminate messages to patients, providers, and educators.

Abstract:	For adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D), daily performance of self-care behaviors improves glycemic control and prevents complications and premature mortality. However, sustained self-care remains highly challenging and high diabetes distress is common. Family members and friends can either reinforce or undermine patients' self-care, and many experience distress about not knowing how to best support the patient's self-care efforts. Although engaging family/friend support persons may be a highly effective way to improve T2D outcomes, this has rarely been investigated. To address these problems, we developed FAMS, a mobile phone-delivered intervention including telephonic coaching focused on improving social support and self-care goals plus text message support for patients, and text messages for their adult support person. Our pilot study demonstrates that FAMS is acceptable, feasible, improves the support patients receive, and that it likely improves self-care. To move this promising line of research forward, we now propose the following specific aims: (aim 1) expand and improve FAMS. We will build on our pilot study by (a) expanding FAMS content beyond diet and physical activity to include regimen-tailored medication adherence strategies, (b) extending its interactive text message functionality to support persons, and (c) enhancing its goal setting element by incorporating evidence-based diabetes education materials. This will be achieved through iterative user-centered testing to identify and resolve content, technical, research process and usability issues; (aim 2) evaluate FAMS 2.0 effects on T2D patients' outcomes. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 334 patient-support person dyads (~50% cohabitating) to evaluate the effects of the expanded FAMS 2.0 intervention versus an attention control (print materials on T2D self-care and access to A1c results) on long-term glycemic control (primary outcome) and psychosocial wellbeing (secondary outcome). Adults with T2D and baseline A1c>7.5% will be identified and recruited via the Mid-South Clinical Data Research Network and will enroll with a support person. We will oversample patients of racial/ethnic minority background or who have low socioeconomic status. Randomization will be performed within binomial strata defined by A1c and distress. The 15-month study timeline will consist of a 9-month intervention period with a 6-month follow-up to evaluate sustained effects. We will also assess key process measures, including coaching fidelity and text message response rates; (aim 3) explore FAMS 2.0 effects on support persons. We will evaluate whether support persons assigned to FAMS 2.0 experience greater improvements in their own support burden and psychosocial wellbeing than those assigned to control; and (aim 4) examine hypothesized moderators and mediators of the effects specified in aims 2 and 3. We will evaluate whether effects on patients and their support persons (SPs) vary by gender and dyadic cohabitation, and if improvements in targeted psychosocial and behavioral mechanisms mediate improvements in patients' and SPs' outcomes. Completion of this proposed research will establish whether this highly novel intervention improves outcomes among adults with T2D and their support persons, for whom, and through what mechanisms. It will also yield an inherently scalable intervention and a robust infrastructure to support subsequent implementation research.

Abstract:	Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a major public health concern affecting nearly 30 million people in the U.S. and increasing their risk for serious complications including blindness, amputations, kidney failure, heart attacks, and strokes. Forty-five percent (45%) of people with diabetes report considerable stress related to their diabetes, which is increasingly being recognized as a key factor in worsening glucose control and the progression of T2DM. The proposed project uses mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a powerful and well-researched mindfulness-based intervention, to address stress as a critical barrier to glucose control in patients with T2DM. The objective of this proposal is to conduct a large, fully powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) to definitively determine the effects of a 6-month MBSR intervention on glucose control in patients with uncontrolled T2DM. We will randomize 290 adults with uncontrolled T2DM to a 6-month MBSR intervention or health education control. The 6-month intervention will consist of the University of Massachusetts standard 8-week MBSR program followed by monthly MBSR booster sessions. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Specific aims are 1) to conduct an RCT to determine the effects of a 6-month MBSR intervention compared to health education on glucose control in 290 patients with uncontrolled T2DM. The primary outcome will be hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a measure of average glucose levels over the past 3 months. We hypothesize that between the two groups, there will be a clinically significant 0.5% absolute difference in the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to month 6. Additionally, we will look at fasting glucose and glucose variability as they are also linked with adverse outcomes; 2) to determine the effects of MBSR versus health education control on psychosocial, behavioral, and physiological mechanisms potentially mediating its glucose lowering effects in patients with uncontrolled T2DM. Subjective stress, diabetes-related distress, and other psychosocial measures will be assessed. Accelerometry will be used to track physical activity. Unannounced phone calls will be used to obtain 24-hour diet recalls. Physiologic measures include serum hsCRP and TNF-alpha as markers of chronic inflammation, salivary cortisol to assess the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and salivary alpha-amylase to assess sympathetic nervous system activity. The proposed study has the potential to transform current standards of care for T2DM by using a novel long-term MBSR intervention as a powerful adjunct intervention for T2DM. MBSR could impact the clinical picture of T2DM by empowering patients with skills for strengthening their own internal resources to promote self-regulation and adaptive coping and reduce stress reactivity, which are all essential for implementing healthy behaviors and are expected to lead to improved glucose control and reduced risk of diabetes complications.

Abstract:	Type 2 diabetes affects 9.4% of US adults with higher rates among racial/ethnic minorities and individuals of low socioeconomic status. The National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) is an evidence-based and widely disseminated behavioral intervention to reduce diabetes incidence through modest weight loss. However, retention in the year-long NDPP is problematic and leads to suboptimal weight loss, especially among Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and low-income non-Hispanic white participants. Strategies to improve NDPP engagement and weight loss are needed urgently, especially for these subgroups. Pilot results of the Pre-NDPP, a novel enhancement to enrollment in the NDPP based on the health belief model, were highly successful in a non-randomized cohort study among 1,140 racially diverse, predominately low-income participants. Outcomes of 75 Pre-NDPP participants who enrolled in the NDPP were compared to 1,065 prior participants using ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) and multivariable logistic regression. Pre-session participants stayed in the NDPP 99.8 days longer (p<.001) and attended 14.3% more sessions (p<.001) on average than those without a pre-session. Pre-session participants lost 2.0% more weight (p<.001) and were 3.5 times more likely to achieve the 5% weight loss target (p<.001). Sensitivity analyses were consistent. Findings suggest pre-sessions may be a promising and pragmatic strategy to improve NDPP effectiveness and mitigate disparities in program outcomes, but a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to determine whether Pre-NDPP reliably improves NDPP outcomes. The purpose of this study is to 1) conduct an RCT comparing NDPP attendance and weight loss outcomes between participants who receive Pre-NDPP vs. direct enrollment into the NDPP (usual care); 2) examine potential effect mediators (perceived risk for developing diabetes and self-efficacy and readiness for weight control) and moderators (race/ethnicity and income level); and 3) evaluate implementation factors, including cost and projected return on investment. The long-term goal is to disseminate a scalable, evidence-based strategy to improve success of the NDPP and reduce disparities in NDPP effectiveness. If found to be effective, Pre-NDPP can be disseminated to all NDPP providers, including more than 1,700 NDPP sites, and may be supported by current NDPP payers such as Medicare, commercial insurers, and employer groups. Thus, this approach has a high potential to impact the burden of type 2 diabetes and related health disparities across the country.

Abstract:	To stem the growing epidemic of chronic diseases in rapidly developing countries like India that face significant resource constraints, prevention programs are needed in rural communities where most people still live. Currently, there is very little evidence known about how to do this. Our research team has already evaluated a novel, community-based, lifestyle intervention to prevent diabetes after 24 months in a high-risk Indian population. We now plan to further assess the outcomes at 7 years.

Abstract:	Nearly 2 million Americans develop a diabetic foot ulcer each year. Dr. Brennan's research team and others documented a >50% mortality and 5% major amputation rate within 5 years of ulceration. Next, they determined that morbidity and mortality associated with ulcers disproportionately burdens rural patients, who have 50% higher odds of major amputation and 40% higher odds of death than urban patients. Dr. Brennan's long-term objective is to eliminate this rural disparity through interventions that improve the quality of diabetic foot ulcer care rural patients receive in the ambulatory setting. Over the past decade, many urban tertiary care centers have developed a model of integrated care for patients with diabetic foot ulcers. The integrated care model involves multiple specialists working side-by-side and following a care algorithm to address 4 precipitating physiologic factors in a coordinated manner: poor glycemic control, vascular disease, mechanical complications, and secondary infection. Dr. Brennan's systematic review found that 97% of these urban integrated care clinics reduced major amputation, with relative risk reductions ranging from 11 to 90%. However, this urban model is difficult to implement in the rural setting, where providers are scarce and geographically dispersed. Dr. Brennan's goal is to become an academic clinician-researcher in infectious disease leading an independent research program to improve care and outcomes of diabetic foot ulcers in rural settings. She proposes a 3-year K08 period with training in clinical trials, stakeholder engagement, systems engineering, implementation science, and advanced quantitative skills. Following her KL2 support, Dr. Brennan is well prepared for a successful K08 award period. Her focused training, expert mentorship, and research plan will catalyze her transition to independence. This proposal heralds her advancement from defining gaps in care to closing them. The primary objective of this proposal is to build and pilot an integrated care algorithm adapted to the rural setting. The proposed aims are to 1) identify which specialists are associated with increased amputation-free survival, and the optimal timing of their involvement; 2) co-design an integrated care algorithm and its implementation plan with rural health care systems; and 3) pilot the algorithm in the rural setting to maximize adoption and implementation. Upon completion of the proposed research and training, Dr. Brennan will be ideally poised to submit a competitive Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) R01 centered on testing the emerging intervention with an effectiveness-implementation study. Her current and future research aims will advance AHRQ's mission by focusing on a high-priority population (rural patients), problem (major amputation), and area of interest (ambulatory care).

Abstract:	What were the results of the original Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) study? The original PCORI study reanalyzed data from the Diabetes Prevention Program, a study first published in 2002 that showed that lifestyle change leading to weight loss or taking the medication metformin both were effective in preventing the development of type 2 diabetes. However, the PCORI researchers found that the effect of metformin varied greatly by individual characteristics, so that among low-risk patients, metformin is not different from placebo (e.g., a sugar pill), but among high-risk patients, metformin works about as well as lifestyle change. The PCORI study developed a risk prediction tool that classified patients into one of four risk quartiles and provided a tailored risk estimate for placebo, lifestyle change, and metformin for individual patients with prediabetes. The project team will integrate this new tailored risk model into an existing shared decision making (SDM) approach that has shown to be effective in a clinical trial and is currently in standard use at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Pharmacists working in primary care clinics meet with patients who have prediabetes to engage them in SDM using a decision aid produced by Healthwise that introduces the concept of prediabetes, presents the evidence for lifestyle change and metformin in diabetes prevention, asks patients about their preferences and values, and helps them choose one of these evidence-based strategies. The pharmacist then sends a message to the patient's primary care provider to inform them about the SDM session and the patient's choice. For this proposal, the project team will replace the current "one-size-fits-all" risk estimates with the tailored risk estimates from the original PCORI study. Why is this research finding(s) important? Over 84 million Americans have prediabetes, although 90 percent are unaware of their condition. Patients who are diagnosed with obesity and have higher blood sugars are particularly likely to develop diabetes in the short term. Several studies have shown that both lifestyle change and metformin are effective in preventing type 2 diabetes, but few patients are engaged in either evidence-based approach. As a condition where there is more than one effective prevention option, prediabetes can be considered a "preference-sensitive" decision. However, current diabetes prevention guidelines from national organizations do not include SDM. An SDM approach using the PCORI tailored risk model creates a patient-centered approach by helping patients make better, more informed, personalized care decisions. What is the goal of this project? The goal of this project is to implement SDM for diabetes prevention within two health systems, UCLA Health and Intermountain Healthcare. The objectives are to study the implementation and gain insights to help sustain the intervention over time and promote future spread to other health systems. Specific aim 1 is to engage patients, providers, and health system leaders in merging the new tailored risk estimate with the current SDM approach for diabetes prevention. Specific aim 2 is to implement the modified SDM approach for patients with prediabetes who are diagnosed with obesity and have higher hemoglobin A1c values (higher blood sugars). Specific aim 3 is to study implementation of this SDM approach and its effectiveness on decisional and clinical outcomes. What is the project team doing? The project team will work closely with patients, primary care physicians, and health system leaders to prepare the participating practices for the SDM implementation, based on a review of common barriers to prior implementation studies. The team at UCLA and the team at Intermountain will reach out to all patients at each practice who meet the study criteria, oversee implementation of the modified SDM intervention, and supervise data collection of the implementation outcomes as well as clinical outcomes. Pharmacists will continue to engage UCLA patients with prediabetes in SDM, and the team will train nurse care managers to engage Intermountain patients with prediabetes. The team will also check in with practice sites regularly to understand how implementation is going and how each practice may have changed some components of the implementation for a better fit in their local setting. How is the team evaluating this project? The project team will evaluate the success of the implementation in several different areas. The team will measure how many of the patients who met the study criteria actually participated in SDM, and how representative those patients are of the patients with prediabetes in each health system. The team will gather information from patients on whether they felt the process was truly a shared decision, using a patient-reported measure (the CollaboRATE questions). The team will also measure how and to what extent the implementation was adopted in each system and in each practice, and will review records, including progress notes produced during the SDM sessions, to ensure that the implementers carried out the SDM sessions exactly as intended. The team will use interviews with clinicians and health system leaders to determine whether the implementation is likely to become part of the routine workflow. The team will also evaluate clinical outcomes for the participating patients with prediabetes using data from the electronic health record, including starting metformin and changes in weight. How is the team involving patients and others in this project? The project team is working with a large and committed group of stakeholders, including patients who have been advising the team as this implementation project was developed. Two patients with prediabetes (one from UCLA and one from Intermountain) will participate in the weekly team meetings and all aspects of the implementation project. An additional three patients with prediabetes and experience with the Diabetes Prevention Program and SDM will serve as consultants during the entire implementation process. The project team will continue their ongoing and productive collaboration with the American Medical Association (AMA), which has prioritized diabetes prevention as an organization. The team is also working with the American Diabetes Association (ADA), which also provides information and services to patients with prediabetes. Additional stakeholders include the leader of the original PCORI-funded study who will help the team build the risk prediction tool into the electronic health record in each system, an expert on implementation science, and leadership from both health systems. How will this project help ensure future uptake and use of PCORI results? Through implementation and use in these two health systems, discussion and presentations at conferences, continued successful outcomes from the SDM approach, and strengthening ongoing relationships with other systems interested in diabetes prevention and building new relationships, this approach will spread to other settings. The project team will specifically work closely with the AMA through the Best Practices Working Group for Diabetes Prevention, the ADA, and Healthwise to accelerate the spread of SDM for diabetes prevention, using the PCORI-generated tailored risk model.

Abstract:	Type II diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease with poor outcomes, and requires daily self-care, including blood glucose monitoring, following a diabetes friendly diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and medication adherence. Patients with diabetes benefit from comprehensive diabetes self-management education (DSME) and self-management support (SMS) in primary care. Shared medical appointments (SMAs) are one way to efficiently and effectively provide DSME and SMS. SMAs can have a variety of different features, but it is not known which features are most effective for which types of patients. Patients and other stakeholders engaged in planning this study proposed a model with diabetes "veterans" (i.e., diabetes peer mentors) co-facilitating group visits with a variety of diabetes care professionals, and then working one-on-one with patients to help apply what they learned. The group visit curriculum should include topics on physical activity, healthy eating, taking medication, acceptance and coping, and social support, and each cohort of patients should get to select topics most relevant to them. The practice stakeholders want to do more comprehensive group visit models, but need to know the extent to which SMA participation and patient-centered outcomes are improved compared to the more common standardized approaches they tend to use now. In this proposed study, we will compare the effectiveness of patient-driven diabetes SMAs to standardized diabetes SMAs. The curriculum to be used is Targeted Training for Illness Management (TTIM), a 12-session modular group intervention for chronic illness self-management, and has been tested in diabetes. The standardized group visit model will consist of diabetes SMAs with the full TTIM 12 session curriculum, led by a health educator. For the patient-driven SMAs, patients choose the topics and the order of sessions from TTIM the curriculum, which is delivered collaboratively by the multidisciplinary care team consisting of several professional providers (health educator, medical provider, and behavioral health provider) and a lay worker (diabetes peer mentor). The primary patient-centered outcome, selected by patient stakeholders, is diabetes distress. Secondary outcomes include autonomy support, quality of life, and diabetes self-management behaviors, clinical outcomes (hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, and body mass index), patient reach and engagement, and practice level value and sustainability. Patient, caregiver, practice, health plans, and research stakeholders will be engaged in all aspects of the research. Patients and other stakeholders will inform the process of implementation of patient-driven and standardized SMAs, help finalize the research protocol (including data collection and recruitment), and contribute to interpretation of findings and dissemination of findings, including messages that help other patients make decisions about whether or not to participate in SMAs.

Abstract:	Background: Toe amputations are often naively viewed as an inconsequential surgical procedure with little functional impact. Instead, a toe amputation is often the inciting event in a cascade of progressive loss of function and quality of life. One in three people undergoing toe amputations due to chronic illness fail to heal the amputation in a timely manner, requiring additional amputation surgery(ies), and one in five dies in the following year. Inadequate healing may be related to suboptimal management of comorbid conditions. Veterans with limited social support may be further limited in their ability to self-manage their illness and engage in treatment to facilitate healing and prevent additional amputation. Veterans who undergo repeated amputations lose functional life years during repeated treatments and recoveries. Objectives: The aims of this study are to 1) to characterize amputation trajectories and evaluate trends in subsequent amputation and death in the year after initial toe amputation overall, based on demographic characteristics, selected clinical factors (e.g., vascular status), and geographic location (e.g., Veterans Integrated Service Networks [VISN]); 2) to evaluate the associations between modifiable risk factors and 1-year risk of subsequent amputation or death while controlling for important risk factors that confound these associations; and 3) to acquire knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to secondary prevention using semi-structured interviews among patients who have undergone a toe amputation and providers who care for these patients to develop future interventions that improve outcomes in these patients. Methods: We will accomplish these goals by using VA electronic medical record data, and in-depth interviews with providers and patients. Our proposed research--a retrospective cohort study including all VHA patients (~20,000) with diabetes with a first ever toe amputation between FY 2005 and 2016--will be the largest study conducted to date, national in scope, and will supplement structured data with unstructured data to ascertain key information about not only the amputation but also other relevant patient characteristics. For aim 1, frequencies and percentages of the following clinical outcomes will be obtained: subsequent amputation within 1, 6, and 12 months; counts of subsequent amputations; the final level of amputation at 12 months; and death. We will formally test for trends across time by including year as a predictor variable in logistic regression models, considering the use of piece-wise regression to allow for non-linear trends. Similar models will be constructed to test for variation across VISN. Key modifiable risk factors for aim 2 include behavioral factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol misuse), revascularization procedure and type, and adequacy of treatment of mental health conditions. For aim 3, we will conduct in-depth interviews with providers and patients who have and have not undergone a subsequent amputation, to gain insight into patient- and system-level barriers to successful healing, policies or other activities that could improve care for patients who undergo a toe amputation, and patient and provider perspectives on factors that they think would lead to improved patient outcomes. Findings: We have no findings to report at this time. Impact: By conducting a detailed evaluation of temporal and geographic variation, identification of modifiable risk factors, and interviews with patients and providers, we will understand system-level and individual-level variation in outcomes. Our study will lay the groundwork to improve amputation prevention at VA.

Abstract:	The economic costs of diabetes are huge with $176 billion in direct medical costs in 2012 and over 30% of Medicare expenditures spent on persons with diabetes. Of all health care expenditures attributed to diabetes, only 14% are spent to treat diabetes itself and the rest are spent to treat diabetic complications. Prevention of diabetic complications is important to reduce the economic burden of diabetes on national health care expenditures. American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend preventive care to reduce the risk of these complications. Because these complications disproportionately affect the elderly, preventive care is also a special area of concern for the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Reducing health disparities and improving rates of preventive care utilization is national priority as reflected in Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce health disparities and improve rates of diabetes preventive care (Objectives D4-D14). The "Diabetes Belt" is a recently identified group of counties with especially high diabetes prevalence (>=11% compared to 8.5% average in the rest of the country). The Diabetes Belt is comprised of two medically disadvantaged populations, namely, low-income whites in Appalachia and blacks in the rural South. These populations have high mortality risk which is mainly attributable to high chronic disease burden. Our analysis of 2008-2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data shows that elderly persons (ages >= 65 years) with diabetes in the Diabetes Belt had almost 30% lower uptake of diabetes preventive services, such as annual foot exam, annual eye exam, and diabetes self-management education, compared to their counterparts in the rest of the country. They also had 12-23% higher rates of diabetes-related comorbidities, such as heart attack, stroke, and health-related disability, than those outside the Belt. The proposed study is a comprehensive research program that involves detecting, understanding, and reducing disparities in diabetes preventive care between the counties in the Diabetes Belt and the surrounding areas and within the Diabetes Belt itself. Detection involves measuring disparities in preventive service use and diabetic complications using Medicare claims data. Understanding involves identifying individual-level and county-level determinants of disparities. Finally, the third phase, "reducing," involves developing optimal policy options using Markov decision process (MDP) analysis. In addition to the traditional factors such as race/ethnicity, income, access to care, and health care supply, we will evaluate the role of public policy (e.g., annual wellness visits) and local community partnerships in reducing disparities in diabetes preventive care use. In addition, we propose to use "efficiency" in producing preventive services such as a new "metric" to measure disparities and to identify areas of targeted action.

Abstract:	The confluence of obesity and pre-diabetes in older adults substantially increases the risk of diabetes, and accelerates functional decline, multimorbidity, disability, and death. More research is needed to refine and extend preventive interventions to reduce burden for elders and society. For over a decade efficacious 6- and 12-month Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle interventions have been translated successfully and demonstrated positive impact. However, efforts to develop and evaluate potentially scalable programs conforming to current guidelines for longer-term DPP interventions (up to 24 months) and help a greater proportion of enrollees achieve and sustain the recommended weight loss target of >= 5% are lacking. Our scientific premise is that the evaluation of translational DPP interventions, which has centered largely on strategies for weight loss induction, must be extended to include longer-term interventions that clearly demonstrate durable weight, cardiometabolic, and functional health benefits especially for vulnerable elders in community-based settings. Our previous DPP-based research has documented the utility of telephone follow-up after a 6-month DPP weight loss induction and shown that 63% of a 65- to 80-year-old volunteer sample with obesity and other risk factors were able to sustain >= 5% weight loss at 12 months. Despite good evidence that longer duration lifestyle interventions yield better outcomes (reflected in the latest Medicare ruling) there are no translational studies of 24-month long DPP interventions with older adults. We now propose to utilize community-based settings to examine whether we can sustain the impact of an elder-focused DPP approach using potentially scalable treatment components over a 24-month period. We will recruit and enroll 65- to 80-year-old adults with obesity and pre-diabetes (N=360) from a network of senior community centers that provide aging services. The intervention program sequencing will be aligned with current Medicare policy. First, from 0-6 months, experienced lifestyle coaches will administer a DPP-video intervention anchored primarily by telephone coaching for all participants, at least 25% from ethnic/racial minority groups. Next, participants, will be randomized (N=180 per arm; stratified by weight loss of < or >= 5%) to one of two 18-month follow-up conditions conducted between 6-24 months. We will compare the effects of (1) DPP-Sustained (DPP-S) and (2) DPP-Minimal (DPP-M) on measures of weight/adiposity (the primary outcome) at 12, 18, and 24 months. In addition, we will collect cardiometabolic, physical activity, physical function, psychosocial, behavioral, and other age-sensitive quality of life measures at 12 and 18 and 24 months. Medicare claims data will also be examined for a proportion of the sample regarding medication use, outpatient, inpatient, and emergency visits and enrollment/participation in elder-focused activity programs. This work, if successful, will have immediate potential for DPP-based lifestyle interventions, which are consistent with a chronic care model, and will benefit vulnerable aging individuals and society.

Abstract:	Despite recent advances in therapy, far too many youth and young adults (YYAs) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly those of minority race/ethnicity, do not achieve optimal glycemic control, thus placing them at increased risk of acute and chronic complications. Among the social determinants of health, household food insecurity (HFI) may be a key barrier to achieving glycemic control and may lead to increased health care utilization and costs, but virtually all of the limited research was cross-sectional and conducted in older adults with T2D. Moreover, racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by HFI, which may underlie similar disparities in diabetes outcomes. Our preliminary work suggests that HFI is a common phenomenon in YYAs with diabetes, affecting 19% of YYAs with T1D and 38% of those with T2D. These rates significantly exceed the 2015 national estimate of 12.7%. We propose a longitudinal study, the SEARCH Food Security (SFS) cohort study, which is designed as an ancillary study to the ongoing CDC/DDT- and NIH/NIDDK-funded SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth 4 study, a racially/ethnically diverse study of diabetes diagnosed in youth. The aims of the SFS study are to (1) initiate a food insecurity cohort study of 1,187 YYAs aged 15-35 years (53% minority) with T1D and T2D by adding two data collection time points to the ongoing SEARCH 4 study; (2) prospectively evaluate the influence of HFI on changes in glycemic control in YYAs with T1D and T2D; (3) quantify the mediating role of nutritional, mental health, and behavioral pathways through which food insecurity may affect changes in glycemic control in YYAs with T1D and T2D; and (4) prospectively evaluate the influence of HFI on changes in health care utilization and medical and non-medical health care costs in YYAs with T1D and T2D. Using the SFS data in tandem with extensive data collected by SEARCH will be highly efficient for addressing these aims. The proposed study will be the first cohort study to examine the impact of food insecurity on glycemic control, health care utilization, and costs among a diverse population of US YYAs with T1D and T2D. Our transdisciplinary team is led by Drs. Liese and Mendoza, recognized experts in diabetes, epidemiology, pediatric medicine, disparities, and food insecurity research, and is supported by a team comprising expertise in pediatric endocrinology, psychology, health behaviors, health economics, biostatistics, and causal inference modeling. The study has the potential to alter diabetes policy and clinical practice by establishing the need for more in-depth assessments of food insecurity among YYAs with diabetes, re-assessment of diabetes management, and nutrition recommendations for food-insecure patients, and integration of food assistance resources into routine care for persons with diabetes. It will also inform the tailoring of interventions to address food insecurity, especially for minorities, in future diabetes research trials.

Abstract:	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is common among persons living with HIV (PLWH), with a prevalence of 10-15%. This rate may be higher in racial and ethnic minority populations. For PLWH who have T2DM (PLWH+T2DM), subpar self-management of either condition can lead to serious complications. Patients can improve morbidity and mortality by engaging in effective self-management but the regimens for managing both HIV and T2DM are complex and extensive. At minimum, patients with T2DM must learn to manage a diabetic diet, take DM medications, monitor blood glucose, perform daily physical activity, and monitor foot problems. PLWH must take HIV medications, monitor for opportunistic infections, and prevent transmission to others. Factors that influence T2DM self-management can be contextual (gender, race/ethnicity), motivational (self-efficacy, social support, depression), psychological (stress, anxiety, depression), and behavioral (diet, self-monitoring, adherence to exercise and treatment regimen). In this mixed-methods study, using a simplified diabetes management model, we will examine (1) factors that predict self-management behaviors and outcomes in PLWH+T2DM and clinical outcomes, using a de-identified patient medical records dataset; and (2) patients' perspectives of self-management challenges. The Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) will provide the quantitative data for ~3,100 PLWH+T2DM within a larger cohort of >31,000 PLWH. To verify significant variables in this cohort and to address variables not included in the dataset, we will conduct 30 qualitative semi-structured interviews with PLWH+T2DM recruited from local HIV care clinics and volunteer organizations regarding their perspectives on barriers and facilitators related to self-management.

Abstract:	Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population worldwide. Although diabetic retinopathy (DR) has been well studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly, many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME. Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME. This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large-scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large. The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD, MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD, MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center.

Abstract:	Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high health care expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identification of diabetic patients at high risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease, while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufficiently studied, problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to perform early identification of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multidimensional temporal nature of patient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identified electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System will be used to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning-based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high-risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multisite study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice.

Abstract:	Diabetes is the seventh-leading cause of death in the United States, can lead to serious complications, and is associated with increased health care costs. Prevalence estimates for veterans show a disproportionate burden of disease, with estimates close to 25%, as compared to 8% of the general US population. Evidence consistently shows racial minorities have a higher prevalence of diabetes, worse outcomes, higher risk of complications, and higher mortality rate compared to non-Hispanic whites. This disparity persists after controlling for patient-level factors such as education, income, knowledge, health literacy, and self-efficacy; provider-level factors, such as bias, communication, and trust; and system-level factors, such as access to care. Little attention has been given to differences that may be explained by regional variation in patient-level resources, community-level resources, and health workforce resources. Objectives: This study seeks to identify and explain spatial and temporal variation in health outcomes, community resources, Veterans Affairs (VA) workforce capacity, and health disparities among patients with type 2 diabetes. Aim 1 will examine spatiotemporal trends in diabetes outcomes, including metabolic control, cost, and mortality. Aim 2 will develop a new spatiotemporal neighborhood deprivation index and examine its association with diabetes outcomes and racial disparities. Aim 3 will develop and validate a novel geographic workforce deprivation index to examine its association with diabetes outcomes and racial disparities. Methods: We will construct a cohort of veterans with type 2 diabetes receiving either inpatient or outpatient care at the VA during the years 2000 through 2015 by linking multiple patient and administrative files from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) National Patient Care and Pharmacy Benefits Management databases, using a previously validated VA algorithm. Using advanced geographic information system (GIS) and spatial statistical methods, we will examine spatiotemporal trends in diabetes outcomes among veterans with type 2 diabetes. In aim 1, we will develop a flexible Bayesian spatiotemporal model to identify hotspots of high prevalence of diabetes-related outcomes. In aims 2 and 3, we will use spatiotemporal latent factor models to develop novel neighborhood and workforce deprivation indices, allowing us to investigate evolving patterns in community resource availability and VA workforce capacity. Completion of these aims will enable the VA to identify individual, community, and institutional factors associated with poor diabetes outcomes and to target community and system-level efforts to improve health in low-resource areas. Findings: No findings to date, project was just awarded May 1, 2018. Impact: This project will put forth a comprehensive geospatial framework to address the VA Blueprint for Excellence Strategy 3: Leverage information technologies, analytics, and models of health care to optimize individual well-being and population health outcomes. By creating a spatially referenced dataset incorporating health information, workforce productivity, and neighborhood deprivation, we will develop a comprehensive database to examine multiple dimensions of diabetes care. Through the use of advanced GIS and spatiotemporal statistics, we will identify hotspots of high disease risk, poor neighborhood resources, and low VA workforce capacity. This information will improve access to care by helping VA policy makers better match resources to areas with poor outcomes. Finally, by pinpointing areas with excessive health expenditures, the VA can develop cost-reduction measures to improve veterans' health while containing costs.

Abstract:	This study will evaluate a comprehensive telemedicine intervention for veterans with persistently poor diabetes control despite clinic-based Veterans Health Administration (VHA) care. Because this approach is designed for delivery via existing home telehealth (HT) services, which are ubiquitous throughout VHA, it may represent an effective, practical alternative for veterans whose diabetes is refractory to clinic-based care. Although efforts by clinicians and researchers have improved diabetes control across VHA, veterans with persistent poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (PPDM) have not benefitted from these advances. We define PPDM as maintenance of a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 8.5% for >1 year, despite receiving clinic-based diabetes care during this period. Veterans meeting this definition--approximately 12% of all veterans with type 2 diabetes--contribute disproportionately to VHA's burden of diabetes complications and costs. While clinic-based care is insufficiently effective in PPDM, telemedicine-based management that comprehensively addresses factors underlying poor diabetes control could improve outcomes for these high-risk veterans. Unfortunately, health care systems have rarely integrated comprehensive telemedicine-based care into real-world practice, even for clinic-refractory conditions like PPDM. This gap stems from the fact that comprehensive telemedicine-based diabetes care has not previously been designed for practical delivery under real-world conditions. In order for telemedicine to fulfill its potential as a means to reduce the burden of PPDM, interventions must be developed with an emphasis on feasible delivery through existing workforce, infrastructure, and technical resources, such that effective implementation is eventually achievable. Until then, veterans with PPDM will be left without alternatives when clinic-based care proves inadequate. Objectives: The proposed trial will evaluate Practical Telemedicine to Improve Control and Engagement for Veterans with Clinic-Refractory Diabetes Mellitus (PRACTICE-DM), a novel, comprehensive telemedicine intervention for PPDM that is designed for practical delivery within VHA. The specific aims of this study are to 1) determine PRACTICE-DM's effectiveness; 2) evaluate PRACTICE-DM's acceptability and mechanisms of effect using a mixed-method process evaluation; and 3) understand costs associated with PRACTICE-DM. Methods: Two hundred veterans with PPDM from two sites (Durham, North Carolina and Richmond, Virginia) will be randomized to receive one of two HT-delivered interventions: 1) PRACTICE-DM, a comprehensive intervention combining telemonitoring, self-management support, diet/activity support, medication management, and depression support; or 2) an active control, standard HT care coordination and telemonitoring. Both interventions will be delivered over a 12-month period and all participants will continue to receive usual VHA care. The primary study outcome will be change in HbA1c from study baseline to 12 months. The secondary outcomes are guided by a theoretical framework, and will include diabetes self-care, diabetes burden, self-efficacy, and depressive symptoms. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with 20 intervention-group veterans, the HT nurses delivering the intervention, and administrators at each site. Intervention costs will be comprehensively assessed and compared to standard HT care coordination and telemonitoring. Findings: None to date. Impact: Although VHA is a leader in telemedicine, its telemedicine capabilities are currently underutilized for veterans with PPDM. These veterans are refractory to clinic-based care, so contribute disproportionately to diabetes complications and costs. This study will leverage VHA's unique telemedicine infrastructure to deliver comprehensive management designed for PPDM, with the goal of improving outcomes in this high-risk, high-cost population. Because the proposed intervention is designed for delivery using existing HT services, it may represent an effective, practical approach to reducing the burden of poor diabetes control across VHA.

Abstract:	This National Library of Medicine (NLM) R01 proposal aims to develop and test a personal health library platform for patients with diabetes and prediabetes, harnessing both personal health and health care data (e.g., medication lists, upcoming appointments, self-tracking of diet and blood sugars) and location-based mapped data about neighborhood health resources (e.g., community reviews about the quality of grocery stores and parks). Diabetes and prediabetes patients have substantial needs for tracking and accessing health and health care information that are poorly met by existing platforms that largely operate in silos. Furthermore, existing digital health tools have not utilized participatory design approaches and have low uptake among specific subgroups, such as racial/ethnic minority and lower income populations. In this project, we will use design science to create and evaluate a new personal health library platform to strengthen and improve the ways in which low-income individuals and communities of color access and interact with personal health data that better reflect their needs and interests. Specifically, we propose to create a new platform that enables patients with diabetes or prediabetes to import their personal health data to a mapping platform, in order to have access to store and view both private and public views of health promoting and health inhibiting community factors in their own neighborhood. This new platform will be titled Mapping to Amplify the Vitality of Engaged Neighborhoods, or MAVEN. In aim 1, we will use inductive observational methods to follow community leaders/health advocates and patients with either diabetes or prediabetes to understand existing health and health care journeys and map existing resources in their neighborhoods. We will recruit patients and community-based organization leaders from 3 San Francisco neighborhoods with the highest prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes, which also correspond with existing San Francisco Health Network clinics in our health care system. In aim 2, we will recruit a second sample of individuals to complete user-centered design methods (e.g., card-sorting and think-a-loud interviews) to prioritize and test prototypes of data elements within the new MAVEN personal health library platform. In aim 3, we will conduct real-world usability testing of a functional version of the MAVEN platform to explore its acceptability and usability in everyday life. Because we will engage racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse patients in this project, we will ensure that the MAVEN personal health library platform is relevant for patients with varying levels of health literacy and technology proficiency. In addition, because we will engage community health advocates and public health care system leaders, our findings will have more direct implications for implementation and dissemination.

Abstract:	Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major health problem in the US that constitutes a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations who continue to suffer disproportionately higher rates of complications. Despite the significant physical and psychosocial impact T2D has on patients' behavioral, functional, and clinical outcomes, much of clinical practice continues to neglect patients' perspective of their T2D giving preference to the physiological aspects of the disease. However, without incorporation of patients' perspective of their health and functional status into diabetes care, achievement of the outcomes desired by patients and primary care providers (PCP) will be unattainable. To address this gap, we will use the technology acceptance model and capability-opportunity-motivation model of behavior to evaluate the efficacy of a technology-based patient-reported outcome (PRO) system, the Modern Journal System (MJS), for management of T2D (MJS DIABETES). MJS is an innovative mobile platform that utilizes text messaging to capture PRO data in real time, enhances patient engagement through data-driven feedback and motivational messages, and creates dynamic data visualizations of the PRO data that can be shared through printed reports and integrated into the electronic health record (EHR). Using a mixed-methods design, we will conduct this study in two phases: 1) a formative phase, using the evidence-based, user-centered design approach; and 2) a clinical efficacy phase. The formative phase will use qualitative methods to a) adapt MJS DIABETES to the needs of PCP and patients with T2D; b) integrate MJS DIABETES into the EHR system, primary care practice, as well as the lives of patients with T2D; and c) evaluate the usability of MJS DIABETES in a subset of T2D patients and PCPs in order to optimize the tool's performance and workflow integration. For the clinical efficacy phase, we will evaluate in a randomized control trial, the efficacy of MJS DIABETES versus usual care (UC) on reduction in HbA1c at 12 months, among 282 patients with T2D who receive care in safety net practices. Patients randomized to the intervention arm will be enrolled in MJS DIABETES where they will receive and respond to PROs via text message, receive data-driven feedback and motivational messages based on patterns of their PROs, and receive journal reports over the 12-month study. PCPs will have access to reports of patients' PRO data through the MJS-EHR interface, which can be viewed during visits with the patient or asynchronously to track patient PROs between visits. Patients randomized to the UC arm will receive standard T2D treatment recommendations, as determined by their PCP. The primary outcome will be mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes will include changes in a) patient adherence to self-care behaviors (e.g., lifestyle and medication recommendations); and b) theoretical mediators of diabetes knowledge, self-efficacy, outcomes expectations, and patient-provider communication. Regardless of group assignment, all outcome data will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

Abstract:	Eighty-six million U.S. adults have prediabetes, and up to 75% of them will eventually develop diabetes. Landmark clinical trials have established that intensive lifestyle interventions (ILI) and metformin are safe and effective treatments to prevent or delay diabetes in adults with prediabetes and overweight/obesity. Despite being included in expert clinical guidelines, these treatments are rarely used, and few studies have explored how to promote their uptake in practice. One possible approach for increasing adoption of ILI and metformin in primary care includes clinical decision support (CDS), which uses electronic systems to create tailored recommendations for evidence-based clinical care. While a large body of evidence demonstrates that CDS can improve the delivery of other recommended preventive services, this approach has not been definitively studied for ILI and metformin. We plan to address this critical knowledge gap by developing and evaluating the Prevent Diabetes Mellitus Clinical Decision Support (PreDM CDS) intervention for community health center patients with prediabetes and overweight/obesity. This novel CDS engages primary care providers and clinical staff to deliver the following intervention components: 1) a decision aid about diabetes prevention developed by our team, 2) an electronic health record (EHR) referral to community-based ILI that meet recommended program requirements, and 3) a prompt for providers to consider prescribing metformin. Clinicians will receive monthly feedback about their use of the PreDM CDS through an existing dashboard. By accomplishing the following specific aims, this definitive R18 study will test the potential for CDS to promote diabetes prevention and weight loss efforts in primary care. In aim 1, we will develop the proposed intervention by translating narrative guidelines about ILI and metformin into CDS, while incorporating extensive feedback from users. Aim 2 is a pragmatic cluster randomized trial, including 6 large community health center sites, which will examine the effectiveness of the PreDM CDS at inducing weight loss and improving other cardiometabolic markers. Aim 3 is a mixed-methods evaluation of the PreDM CDS, exploring its reach, adoption, implementation, maintenance, and cost. We hypothesize that the proposed PreDM CDS will increase patients' adoption of ILI and metformin, producing weight loss and improvements in other cardiometabolic markers. The resulting data, and an implementation toolkit created by the study team, will support the widespread dissemination of the PreDM CDS if found to be effective in the proposed study. Our proposal is responsive to PA-17-261 by 1) developing new CDS that incorporates evidence-based guidelines for diabetes prevention that are infrequently used in current clinical practice; 2) evaluating the impact of the proposed CDS on patient outcomes, clinical workflows, health care process measures, adherence to guidelines, and costs; and 3) conducting this R18 study in a health center-controlled network that serves a minority-predominant population and has the capacity to disseminate the proposed PreDM CDS throughout its national network of community health centers serving 2 million patients.

Abstract:	The Hispanic population in the U.S. aged 65 and older has been growing rapidly and is projected to increase 5-fold between 2012 and 2050, when Hispanics are expected to make up more than 18% of the older adult population. Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. Disease diagnosis is often the basis for estimating prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in the population. People of Hispanic origin, however, are at greater risk of underdiagnosis because of the unique challenges they face accessing and interacting with the health care system. The main objectives of the proposed project are two-fold: 1) to obtain estimates of hypertension and diabetes prevalence for different Hispanic subpopulations, defined by ethnic origin, nativity, and time in the U.S.; and 2) to determine how sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment interact to influence risk for hypertension and diabetes. Data for this project come from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which includes a large diverse sample of Hispanics, information on both disease diagnosis and direct assessments of disease risk, and contextual data on the social, economic, and health care environment. Multilevel modeling and logistic regression models will be used to 1) examine the association between sociocultural factors and reported and measured disease prevalence; 2) determine if variation in health insurance and health care utilization accounts for Hispanic group differences in hypertension and diabetes; and 3) determine if variation in the sociomedical environment account for Hispanic differences in hypertension and diabetes.

Abstract:	Obesity is a complex disease that needs to be managed in a manner which highlights healthy habits over weight loss, begins early in life, and requires collaboration and trust between families and health care providers. However, health care professionals, like family doctors, do not receive a lot of information on how to address weight management with their patients, especially during childhood. To address this knowledge gap, we are creating a "toolkit" of educational videos based on a treatment framework called the 5As of Pediatric Obesity Management (Ask, Assess, Advise, Agree, and Assist). Video-based education has the advantage of being engaging and easy to use. The videos will outline ways to address weight-related topics with children and families in order to promote healthy lifestyle behaviours and prevent eating disorders and other weight-related problems. There are not a lot of resources or tools to help health care professionals discuss these topics in a sensitive, positive, and easy way. Health care professionals (primary care family physicians, pediatricians, and nurse practitioners, as well as resident and nurse trainees) will take part in our study. They will fill out a questionnaire before and after watching the videos, and we will measure whether their self-reported ability to address weight-related topics with their patients improves, as well as their self-reported knowledge. We believe our educational videos, which will be developed based on the best evidence available, will improve the ability of health care professionals to manage weight-related issues and positively impact communication with patients.

Abstract:	Living with diabetes and other chronic (ongoing) conditions is common in older adults. These individuals have poorer health and higher use of health services compared to older adults with diabetes alone. Programs that help older adults self-manage their diabetes and other health conditions benefit both individuals and the health care system. The McMaster University Aging, Community and Health Research Unit developed and tested a new patient-centered, community-based program to improve the delivery and outcomes of care for older adults with diabetes and other chronic conditions. This 6-month program was developed in partnership with patients, caregivers, primary and community care providers, and researchers. The program is delivered by nurses, dietitians, and community providers. It involves in-home visits by nurses and dietitians, monthly group wellness sessions at community centers, and monthly team meetings. Wellness sessions include exercise, education, shared meals, and social support. Caregivers are invited to be active participants along with patients. The program was successfully implemented in Ontario and Alberta. Participants who received the program had better quality of life, self-management, and mental health at no additional cost compared to those receiving usual care. To determine how the program can best help people, more testing is needed with different communities and groups of people. We will partner with primary health care teams (e.g., family doctors' offices) in three provinces to adapt and test the program in a variety of real-world settings. We will assess how to best put this program into practice and measure outcomes important to patients and caregivers so study results are relevant to them. Study findings will guide the development of a plan for expanding the program to reach and benefit more older adults with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Patients and caregivers will be involved as key partners in all aspects of the research.

Abstract:	Objectives: The problem of overtreatment of diabetes (as assessed by glycohemoglobin [HbA1c or A1c], which provides an estimate of glycemic control) and the related occurrence of hypoglycemia and its complications is common. Among the important factors which account for this problem is the lack of understanding of the appropriate use of hypoglycemia-prone medications (insulin and sulfonylureas) and of the relationship between the benefits versus the risks of intensive glycemic control. The goal of this project is to develop and pilot test decision communication aid(s) and supporting tools to facilitate shared decision making around the individual choice of a target A1c range for glycemic control and reduce the frequency of hypoglycemia. Specific aim 1 is to develop a decision aid that can be used in a usual patient encounter to inform clinical decision making around glycemic control and the choice of a target for A1c. Specific aim 2 is to conduct a pilot test of the glycemic control target communication decision aids and assess the impact of the choice on an A1c target, occurrence of hypoglycemia, glycemic control, and the impact on measures of patient involvement, understanding, and satisfaction in decision making. Research plan: This pilot project is designed to support preliminary studies required for a large-scale trial of a decision aid that supports shared decision making about A1c targets. Specifically, we will develop the decision aid, a critical component of the intervention, refine the outcome measures, and obtain data to inform power analyses, essential for the design of a randomized controlled trial. Such a trial will be important not only to test effectiveness of the decision aid itself, but also to assess the performance of a decision aid developed in one context and applied in other similar but not identical contexts. Methodology: Aim 1. We will utilize a rapid cycle/iterative process with concurrent evaluation. This design-centered research approach involves three steps: (1) user-centered observation of current clinical encounters, (2) multidisciplinary synthesis of current practice, and (3) iterative development of decision aid prototypes. Since this approach requires that all types of individuals who will use the decision aid to be involved, patients and clinicians, as well as designers, contribute to the development of the decision aid in context. For this aim, a formative evaluation will primarily be qualitative. Aim 2. We will conduct a pilot study (pre-test/post-test design) and assess it using mixed methods--qualitative analysis of interviews as well as a comprehensive series of quantitative surveys and other measures. Clinical significance: This project has both clinical and research significance. Overtreatment of diabetes in veterans (and others) is common and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. This project is also aligned with the goals of the National Action Plan for Adverse Drug Events, one of which is to reduce hypoglycemia from diabetes agents. This Plan has informed the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) ongoing Choosing Wisely/Hypoglycemia Safety Initiative. From a research perspective, this process tests a novel approach to decision aid design that addresses the low adoption rate of decision aids. Normalization process theory supports the development of decision aids in the context in which they will be used (honoring the importance of minimizing disruption to the work flow) and by all the stakeholders that will use them (recognizing that patients and clinicians have an important role to play in collaboration).

Abstract:	Over half of Hispanics/Latinos will develop type 2 diabetes in their lifetime. This increases the risk of death and other health issues such as amputation by 50-100% more than for non-Hispanic white patients with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes telemanagement programs (DTM) can now use technology to connect patients with their care provider for a weekly "tele-visit" and allow them to have their blood sugar and vital signs monitored daily. The purpose of this study is to see whether providing this kind of programming will improve care for patients with type 2 diabetes, compared to comprehensive outpatient management, the most common treatment approach for Hispanic patients from lower income and health access communities. There are two parts to this study. The first part uses qualitative methods to "adapt" the DTM program intervention for Hispanic/Latino disparity patients, using a community advisory board comprised of patients, caregivers, community leaders, and other important stakeholders such as community-based organizations (Vida Si, Diabetes No) and the American Diabetes Association. The second part tests this "adapted" program scientifically using what is called a randomized controlled trial, to see if it is more effective than comprehensive outpatient management. Patients who receive comprehensive outpatient management receive clinic care to manage their type 2 diabetes, while the patients who receive DTM (and their caregivers--such as their children) will be given tablets (like an iPad) that easily connects them to the nurse practitioner. The caregiver part of the program was suggested by our community advisory board, as well as by interviews with patients. The idea is that patients who are more engaged in their care through DTM will experience less illness, less hospitalization, have a better quality of life, and be more self-confident in their ability to manage their diabetes. We also want to see if involving caregivers improves the care and quality of life of patients. While this kind of intervention has been studied in the general population, and has found that sugar management improves, no one has studied whether this will be better for Hispanic disparity patients with type 2 diabetes--so this will be the first study of its kind. This study is an important one, because our patients tell us (and other studies have shown) that the outcomes we are focusing on are important to them. We are looking at quality of life, confidence in managing diabetes, hospitalizations, use of emergency department services, and worry ("distress") about their diabetes. Patients and other stakeholders are very involved in this project--both as part of the research team and as members of the community advisory board, which guides the research team through all aspects of the study. We also involve patients in "theater testing"--where we "test" the intervention with patients.

Abstract:	Anticipated impacts on veterans' health: This study will determine the extent to which disability compensation and more generous Veterans Affairs (VA) health benefits among Vietnam-era veterans improved short- and long-term outcomes of diabetes. This contribution is significant because one-quarter of VA enrollees have diabetes, and the complications related to diabetes account for substantial morbidity and spending among veterans. Prior research suggests that intermediate and long-range outcomes in diabetes may be related to social determinants of health. We evaluate the health effects of a VA policy that directly intervenes on a key social determinant (income) among veterans with diabetes. Project background: In July 2001, the VA expanded the medical eligibility criteria for Vietnam-era veterans to include diabetes as a service-connected condition. The change in policy was motivated by an Institute of Medicine (IOM) study of the association of Agent Orange, an herbicide used by the U.S. government during the Vietnam War, with the onset of type 2 diabetes. Specifically, any veterans who had "boots on the ground" (BOG) in Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos during the 1964 to 1975 period was deemed to be exposed to Agent Orange and therefore eligible for disability compensation and more generous health benefits, including zero medication copayments. The approximately 55% of Vietnam-era veterans who did not have BOG during the war (Not on Ground [NOG]) were ineligible for disability compensation due to diabetes. Prior work by members of our research team found that the 2001 policy change led to a 30% relative increase in income for veterans with BOG relative to their NOG counterparts. The value of these benefits is further enhanced because they are not subject to federal taxes and are made in perpetuity irrespective of other employment income. Project objective: The overall objective of this application is to examine the impact of a major change in VA policy that led to increased disability compensation and health benefits for some, but not all, Vietnam-era veterans with diabetes. We have the following specific aims: (aim 1) examine whether increased benefits to Vietnam-era veterans with diabetes resulted in better control of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood pressure, and increased adherence to medications; (aim 2) examine whether increased disability and health benefits to Vietnam-era veterans with diabetes reduced micro and macrovascular complications of diabetes; and (aim 3) examine whether more generous benefits to Vietnam-era veterans with diabetes lowered mortality. Project methods: Using a quasi-experimental study design that includes 15 years of follow-up data (2001-2016), we will examine the effects of increased annual income as well as more generous health coverage on a comprehensive set of short- and long-term outcomes of diabetes. Data on our main treatment variable, BOG status, will come from the Office of Economic Manpower Analysis (OEMA) of the U.S. Army. This data will be merged at the individual level with data on all Vietnam-era army veterans who are enrolled in the VA health care system as of July 2001. This data will provide us with detailed outcomes on medication adherence, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, diabetic complications, and mortality. Our study population will focus on veterans with a diagnosis of diabetes prior to July 2001 to avoid the potential bias that eligible veterans who had BOG may have been motivated to be diagnosed with diabetes after the policy change. In our primary study design, we propose to compare the change in the time trend in the BOG-NOG difference in outcomes before and after the policy change (2001 and prior years vs. 2002 and later years).

Abstract:	With an estimated 30.2 million diagnosed and undiagnosed cases among adults (and another 84 million at risk), diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions and a leading cause of mortality in the US. Diabetes self-management education and training (DSME/T) is a recognized standard of care and provides patients with the requisite knowledge and skills to properly manage the condition, improve long-term health outcomes, and reduce health care spending. Yet, only (58%) of adults with diabetes report ever receiving formal DSME/T. Health insurance coverage that does not include benefits for DSME/T effectively imposes barriers to access for patients with limited financial resources. Many states have adopted legislation that requires public and/or private insurers to provide benefits for DSME/T; however, these requirements vary by state. It is unclear if these policies effectively improve access to DSME/T services. The objective of this proposal is to rigorously assess the impact of state-mandated health insurance benefits and reimbursement provisions on access to DSME/T among vulnerable, low-income patients with diabetes. Aim 1, quantify the change in the supply of DSME/T programs and certified providers (potential access) before and after the adoption of state-mandated benefits, tests the hypothesis that enactment of DSME/T insurance requirements is associated with an increase in the number of accredited DSME/T programs and certified providers within a state. This aim merges two novel datasets to provide a census of accredited DSME/T programs and certified providers and detail provisions of state benefit mandates over a period of ten years for 30 US states. Aim 2, quantify the impact of state-mandated insurance benefits on utilization (realized access) of DSME/T, tests the hypothesis that Medicaid insurance requirements increases utilization of DSME/T among Medicaid patients with diabetes. This aim will utilize a 9-year panel from twenty states included in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) from 2008 to 2016. Aim 3, examine the association between patients' evaluated need for DSME/T and providers' referral orders for DSME/T (equitable access), will utilize electronic health record data (2010-2017) from a safety net population to test the hypothesis that patients' "evaluated need" will increase the likelihood of receiving a DSME/T referral during a provider encounter. The proposed study is significant because it rigorously measures the impact of decades of state policies to address a "priority condition" in the US. This study is innovative because it extends the evidence base for diabetes care services through the use of novel data sources and a more sophisticated and policy-relevant measurement approach. Lastly, the proposed study effectively targets a high-priority research area as defined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ): increasing the accessibility of health care.

Abstract:	Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP, is a board-certified internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a research scientist I (equivalent to assistant professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan's research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the research aims of this K23 are to 1) use electronic health record (EHR) data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control; 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management; and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning health care delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed research and training plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 research aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator.

Abstract:	Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases among children. Managing type 1 diabetes is a complicated, labor-intensive effort as one has to monitor blood glucose levels throughout the day, monitor diet, exercise, inject insulin, and adjust insulin based on these activities. The failure to engage in appropriate self-care behavior is problematic as uncontrolled blood sugars can pose both short-term and long-term threats to health. Adolescence is characterized as a developmental period in which youth with type 1 diabetes face difficulties in maintaining good glycemic control, in part due to declines in self-care behavior. Much of the research aimed at this decline has focused on the family, but peer relationships are another important and neglected aspect of youths' social environment. Thus, the present proposal focuses on the role that friends play in the psychological, behavioral, and physical health of adolescents with type 1 diabetes. We have three specific aims: (1) to examine the relations of friend integration and friend conflict to psychological wellbeing and diabetes outcomes (self-care behavior, glycemic control); (2) to identify potential mechanisms that explain the link of friend integration and friend conflict to these outcomes; (3) to examine the trait of unmitigated communion (i.e., over-involvement in others to the neglect of the self) as a moderator of the relations of friend integration and friend conflict to outcomes, predicting that links will be stronger for those high in unmitigated communion. We hypothesize that friend conflict will lead to increased psychological distress, distraction from self-care, failure to discuss diabetes, and the perception that friends will respond negatively to the enactment of diabetes self-care. Because the literature on the positive aspects of friendship to diabetes outcomes is mixed, we examine mechanisms for potential positive and negative relations. To the extent that friend integration is beneficial, potential mechanisms include positive affect, disclosure to friends about diabetes, and the perception that friends will respond positively to self-care. To the extent that friend integration is detrimental, potential mechanisms include vulnerability to friend influence and distraction. Because peer relationships occur in the context of family relationships, we also will examine the synergy between the two relationships. We will enroll 160 teens with diabetes in 9th through 11th grades and conduct an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study over a 4-day period in which interactions with friends and family are assessed as well as previously noted mechanisms. EMA is an innovative method that allows one to tap ongoing experiences as they naturally unfold and to examine within-person variability in links of friend relations to outcomes. The procedure will be repeated 6 months later at year end. Survey measures of variables will be assessed as a second approach to address the same questions. Regression, multilevel modeling, mediation, moderation, and mediated moderation will be used. The research is highly significant in focusing on friends, using multiple methods, creating an innovative measure of friend knowledge, and employing a strong focus on mechanisms.

Abstract:	Authority: Section 1115A of the Social Security Act (as added by section 3021 of the Affordable Care Act). Description: The Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP) expanded model is a structured intervention with the goal of preventing type 2 diabetes in individuals with an indication of prediabetes. The clinical intervention consists of a minimum of 16 intensive core sessions of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) approved curriculum furnished over six months in a group-based, classroom-style setting that provides training in long-term dietary change, increased physical activity, and behavior change strategies for weight control. After completing the core sessions, less intensive follow-up meetings help ensure that the participants maintain healthy behaviors. The primary goal of the expanded model is at least 5 percent weight loss by participants. The MDPP is an expansion of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), which was tested by the National Institutes of Health in a clinical trial, by the CDC through its National DPP, and through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation's Health Care Innovation Awards. In 2016, the Secretary of Health and Human Services determined that the DPP model test met the statutory criteria for expansion, and the calendar year (CY) 2017 Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) Final Rule established that the MDPP will be covered as an additional preventive service under Fee-for-Service Medicare. In 2017, additional expanded model structures and requirements were established in the CY 2018 PFS Final Rule. The MDPP evaluation will assess the effectiveness of the new Medicare benefit providing access to DPP services to all Medicare beneficiaries. Intervention period: The Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program Expanded Model began in April 2018 and is expected to be ongoing. Evaluation period: The evaluation began in September 2018 and is scheduled to end in September 2024.

Abstract:	Type 2 diabetes affects over 29 million US adults, with a disproportionate burden of disease borne by low-income populations. Effective self-management requires attention, planning, follow-through, and consistent performance of multiple health behaviors to prevent negative health outcomes. For low-income individuals, though, health improvement is often superseded by the drive to fulfill basic needs such as food, housing, personal safety, and money for necessities. Having unmet basic needs overwhelms a person's ability to maintain health behaviors. Our prior research has demonstrated that with more unmet basic needs, low-income individuals are less likely to even remember let alone act on a referral for needed health services. However, when unmet needs are resolved and/or people have a personal navigator to help, the likelihood of acting on a health referral significantly increases. Traditionally, patient navigators help coordinate care, manage disease, or promote screening and preventive behaviors. We propose expanding this role to include identifying and resolving unmet basic needs, which we expect will facilitate behavior change and improve health outcomes. We will test this approach in a pragmatic randomized trial conducted in partnership with Louisiana Healthcare Connections, the largest Medicaid managed care plan in Louisiana. Specifically, we propose a multidisciplinary, multimethod study with three aims. Using observational methods, we will examine the type and number of basic needs experienced by Medicaid members, and how those needs impact health outcomes and health care utilization over time by linking basic needs data with claims data (aim 1). In a pragmatic randomized trial, we will test the effectiveness (aim 2) and cost-effectiveness (aim 3) of a basic needs navigation intervention compared to usual care among 500 adults (ages 18-75) with Medicaid, type 2 diabetes, and one or more unmet basic needs. The primary hypothesis is that intervention participants will have a greater reduction (M=0.5%) in HbA1c pre-post compared with usual care participants. Consistent with our conceptual model of the effects of unmet basic needs on health outcomes, we also will examine barriers to self-care (e.g., attention, stress, sleep), health behaviors (e.g., glucose monitoring, diet, clinical screenings), and secondary health outcomes (e.g., emergency department utilization, hospitalization, quality of life). Louisiana Healthcare Connections will identify eligible members for study recruitment and provide basic needs navigation for 6 months. The research team will recruit, enroll, randomize, and survey study participants by phone at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. All HbA1c data will be obtained from electronic medical records between 1-3 months pre-baseline and 12 months post-baseline to assess change. If effective and cost-effective, the intervention has an accelerated path to wide diffusion through Louisiana Healthcare Connections' parent company, Centene Corporation, which is the largest Medicaid managed care company in the U.S., with Medicaid plans in 28 other states.

Abstract:	Serious mental illnesses (SMI), including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder, are associated with increased medical comorbidity and premature mortality from diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Unhealthy lifestyles, including energy-dense (obesogenic) diet, sedentary behavior, and cigarette smoking are important risk factors for diabetes and accelerated biological aging. All of these risk factors are potentially modifiable. There is considerable literature documenting the effectiveness of strategies to prevent and manage diabetes in the general population; yet, these interventions are rarely offered to people with SMI. Residential care facilities (RCFs), called board-and-care homes in California, are a common housing modality for patients with SMI; they provide a venue that can maximize efficiency and sustainability of a lifestyle intervention. The goals of the proposed four-year study are to tailor a multi-component intervention to this high-risk group. The study will be a hybrid effectiveness-implementation (hybrid type 1) trial of a Multi-component Intervention for Diabetes risk reduction in Adults with SMI (MIDAS) in licensed RCFs in San Diego county. As a hybrid type 1 study, the primary emphasis will be on determining the effectiveness of the intervention to achieve desired health outcomes while also systematically collecting data on its implementation within RCFs that will inform implementation strategy refinement. Main components of MIDAS include (1) education about diabetes and lifestyle, (2) dietary intervention at the facility and resident level, (3) increased physical activity, and (4) smoking cessation/reduction. We will employ a modified cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge, and adaptive trial design involving 210 residents with SMI and 120 staff members from 12 RCFs. The RCFs will be divided randomly into four cohorts of three RCFs each. Each cohort will be tested over a 15-month period that includes three phases: a three-month initial control phase (no intervention, from baseline month 0 to end of month 3), a six-month intervention phase (months 4 through 9), and a six-month follow-up phase (no intervention, months 10 through 15). All the study participants will be assessed quarterly during the 15-month period. Our investigators will train RCF staff (especially the activity director and cook) to increase physical activity and reduce smoking, and to implement healthful dietary modifications among the residents, using evidence-based interventions. During the intervention phase, the RCF activity director will conduct twice-weekly manualized group sessions on education about diabetes, nutrition, exercise, and smoking cessation/reduction, to deliver a multi-component group intervention. We will also explore if there are improvements in blood-based research biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation in the RCF residents with SMI. This project is responsive to RFA-MH-17-608 and related to National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Strategic Objective #3.3B: testing interventions for effectiveness in community practice settings. If successful, MIDAS will be sustained and disseminated, and would lead to reduction in excess medical comorbidity and mortality associated with SMI.

Abstract:	Despite the high importance patients place on the role of cost in their care, evidence-based, scalable interventions are needed to address prevalent health-related financial burdens and unmet social determinants of health (SDHs) that impair the ability of adults with uncontrolled diabetes to adhere to effectively manage their condition. Solutions need to optimize the time of busy providers and overburdened delivery systems to address complex patient needs. The long-term goal of this research is to improve health behaviors and outcomes by better engaging patients in care, and to develop effective mechanisms that identify and address their unmet SDHs and health-related financial burdens that contribute to adverse health outcomes. In this study, we will refine and test the effectiveness of Care$olutions--an automated e-health tool for tailored screening of health-related financial burdens and unmet SDHs that informs and activates patients with uncontrolled diabetes to take steps in accessing resources and engaging in self-care. Our central hypothesis is that activating patients with uncontrolled diabetes and linking them to resources to address financial burden and unmet SDHs will improve both intermediate outcomes and measures of disease control (e.g., HbA1c) above and beyond existing services, especially for high-need patients. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) determine the effectiveness of Care$olutions relative to existing services in order to improve glycemic control and patient-centered outcomes such as cost-related non-adherence (CRN) behaviors and perceived financial burdens; and 2) use quantitative methods to examine the role of patient risk factors (moderators) and behavioral factors (e.g., uptake and use of resources) (mediators) on the effectiveness of Care$olutions in improving outcomes. We will use user-centered design to ensure that features of Care$olutions provide long-term sustainability. A total of 720 patients with uncontrolled diabetes (type 1 and type 2) who engage in CRN or perceive financial burden will be recruited from the University of Michigan Diabetes Registry and randomized to receive a 15- to 20-minute web-based program with routine follow-up (Care$olutions), versus contact information for existing assistance services in the health system. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 6- and 12-month follow-up via survey data (validated with health records) and HbA1c assessments. The proposed research is innovative because it provides a comprehensive, low-literacy e-health tool to guide patients through identification of health-related financial burdens and unmet SDHs that impact disease management, links them directly to resources, and provides training to address needs with providers. It addresses a significant gap in care by evaluating an approach to addressing patient needs that optimizes their health and the time of providers. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to yield an evidence-based scalable method to address resource needs of socioeconomically vulnerable populations to improve treatment adherence, reduce health disparities, and diabetes complications.

Abstract:	Most patients with type 2 diabetes are treated first with a medicine called metformin, which helps the body to better use the natural insulin it produces. However, many doctors are reluctant to use metformin to treat patients who have kidney disease, which is a very common problem for people how have diabetes. This is because experiences fifty years ago with drugs similar to metformin showed that some of them were dangerous in kidney disease. Since then, it has become clear that metformin is safe in patients with very mild kidney disease, but we still do not know enough about metformin's safety in people with more serious kidney disease. We will use a very large collection of medical records and laboratory results from patients with diabetes and kidney disease who are treated with metformin, compared to the patients who are treated with commonly used alternative drugs. We will analyze the blood sugar results and the number of people with side effects including very low blood sugar. Our goal will be to determine which patients are better off taking metformin than other drugs, and whether metformin should be used even in patients with serious kidney disease. The results of this project will help to inform patients with diabetes and their physicians about what medication to use to achieve the best outcomes. In this entire project, from the beginning to end, patients will be partners in the research. The patient partners will advise about what research questions are most important and what kind of analysis of the data to do. They will also help to interpret the results. After the findings are known, patient partners will be part of the team that explains the study, its findings, and how diabetes care can be improved in the future.

Abstract:	Challenges to controlling blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels put 16 million U.S. adults at high risk of disabling diabetes complications. Diabetes self-management (DSM) interventions have struggled to deliver relevant, effective, and sustainable support for at-risk adults with diabetes to improve multiple key DSM behaviors, become more activated participants in health care, and reduce diabetes complications. One largely untapped resource for this support is patients' family and friends. Seventy-five percent of adults with diabetes reach out to an unpaid family member or friend (a family supporter) for ongoing help with diabetes management. However, diabetes management interventions to date lack structured and tested approaches to directly engage patients' supportive family members in promoting and sustaining patient activation and improved diabetes management. The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a novel strategy--Family Partners for Health Action (FAM-ACT)--to individual patient-focused diabetes self-management education (DSME) and care management. FAM-ACT directly engages family supporters of at-risk adults with diabetes by providing them the core skills to allow them to effectively support health behavior change, medication adherence, and active engagement with patient's health care providers. A fundamental focus of FAM-ACT is providing family with the ability to give autonomy supportive and need-responsive help to patients. Community health workers (CHWs) will deliver FAM-ACT to low-income patients and their family supporters, plus take the novel step of helping family supporters integrate their efforts with those of patients' primary care teams. The specific aims of this study are to 1) compare the effect of FAM-ACT on patients' diabetes health outcomes to standard, individually focused, CHW-led DSME and care management (DSME+CM); 2) compare the effect of FAM-ACT on patient health behaviors and perceived support to standard, individually focused DSME+CM; and 3) examine whether health and health behavior gains made in FAM-ACT are better sustained after the intervention period than those made in DSME+CM. A total of 240 patient + family member pairs will be randomized to FAM-ACT or DSME+CM for 12 months. Main diabetes health outcomes will include change from baseline to 12 months in UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study) 5-year cardiac risk score, HbA1c, and systolic blood pressure. Main patient behavioral outcomes will include diabetes self-management behaviors, and perceived social support and autonomy supportiveness from family. Sustainability will be assessed at 18 months, after a period of 6 months without CHW intervention. We expect this study to produce an innovative, evidence-based protocol and tool set that leverages family support to help patients optimize and sustain management of multiple diabetes complication risk factors over time. This project is innovative because it provides family supporters with underlying support, communication, and health behavior facilitation techniques that can be applied to improving and sustaining multiple healthy behaviors underlying diabetes management, combines the potential additional effectiveness and sustainability of effective family support with the demonstrated effectiveness of CHWs, and integrates family support with patient-centered medical care.

Abstract:	As more individuals from diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D), there is a concomitantly escalating need to address the disparities in diabetes outcomes in these populations. Although young adulthood is a challenge for all patients with diabetes, minority and low socioeconomic young adults (YA) face even more obstacles to ideal management. Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) provides care to a large YA population with T1D, with 54% receiving public or no insurance, and 85% reporting minority status. Due to poor outcomes in this population, there is an imminent need for alternative care models to improve engagement of YA with T1D in clinical care and address the barriers to improved health outcomes. Previous telemedicine initiatives for T1D have yielded positive glycemic control results, especially in YA, and may be one way to reach this high-risk population. We propose to adapt the previously established, successful combination of telemedicine and shared medical appointments, "CoYoT1 Clinic" (Colorado Young Adults with T1D), to the Southern California YA population. Using meticulously designed study methods involving patient advisors, quantitative and qualitative data collection, collaboration with local stakeholders, intervention development, and patient randomization to telemedicine or in-person clinical visits, we will address the needs of high-risk YA in Southern California, with the goals of increasing access to care, improving follow-up frequency, and strengthening patient and provider satisfaction. Ultimately, we will bring greater value to health and health care with increased patient retention and care recommendations optimized for each patient's home environment and life.

Abstract:	The severity of T1D complications warrants an urgent need to improve glycemic control since 22% and 17% of children and adolescents with T1D, respectively, have suboptimal A1C >9.5%. Moreover, the T1D Exchange recently showed that an average A1C of 9% in 13- to 17-year-olds is not much lower than the A1C average of 9.5% seen in the same age group at the beginning of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) over 30 years ago. In fact, youth ages 2-17 years have an average A1C of 8.6%. In addition, there is an alarmingly high rate of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the United States, with 7% of youth <18 years of age hospitalized for DKA. NIDDK recognizes that DKA, a serious acute complication, in youth must be addressed and strategies to reduce it developed, including significantly reducing time spent in hyperglycemia. Suboptimal adherence to critical T1D management behaviors (e.g., blood glucose monitoring, insulin dosing), either alone or in combination with psychosocial stressors, may lead to suboptimal glycemic control. Indeed, individuals with T1D and mental health comorbidities are 2x as likely to be in suboptimal glycemic control, yet 30% of T1D care teams do not have access to onsite mental health services. Moreover, mental health comorbidities are associated with worsening long-term complications. One possible pathway to improving glycemic control is to increase access via home telehealth. This study is novel as it will use home telehealth intervention to address suboptimal T1D management and glycemic control by integrating medical and behavioral health (i.e., psychological) interventions to reduce negative and costly physical health outcomes in high-risk youth with T1D. The primary objective of this study is to address the critical need of providing intervention to high-risk (A1C=9-12%) youth with T1D. If achieved, T1D care practices will change by providing high-risk youth with T1D and their parents medical and behavioral health support via home telehealth intervention, which has the potential to significantly change access to T1D care, decrease time spent in hyperglycemia, reduce the frequency of hospital admissions, and improve glycemic control. In addition, use of Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), a highly efficient experimental strategy to determine effective intervention components, should be generalizable to all individuals with T1D, leading to cost-effective, home telehealth intervention programs. Innovative aspects include 1) assessment of physical and behavioral health characteristics associated with high-risk status; 2) delivery of home telehealth that incorporates 2a) medical and behavioral health care delivered with the endocrinologist and behavioral health specialist working together with high-risk youth, 2b) personalized intervention to improve T1D adherence and T1D clinical health outcomes, 2c) personalized intervention to improve mental health comorbidities and T1D clinical health outcomes; and 3) an underused methodological approach for optimizing intervention components to be delivered at point of care.

Abstract:	Background: Currently over 3 million veterans have been registered for the VA patient portal, My HealtheVet (MHV). The portal's features, such as enabling veterans to refill their medications, send secure messages to their clinical teams, and read their clinician's notes, are integral to VHA's goal of expanding veteran-facing virtual modalities. Use of MHV features has been associated with improvements in diabetes physiologic measures. However, use of MHV features varies considerably, and little is known about how patients and clinical teams can best leverage features to improve self-management, health care processes and outcomes. Objectives: This study is designed to uncover the patient portal features associated with improved outcomes and clarify how patients can best leverage them to manage their diabetes. Our primary objectives are to (aim 1) generate new information for feature selection and personalizing interventions, (aim 2) generate details about how patients are effectively using the patient portal, and (aim 3) conduct a small-scale experiment to test the feasibility of engaging veterans in a supported adoption intervention to promote effective MHV use in veterans with diabetes. Methods: Aims 1 and 2 will use a longitudinal cohort-with-nested-case-control design to learn how patients with diabetes use the portal and what patterns of use are associated with better outcomes. Qualitative data from aim 2 and veteran co-investigators will provide direct veteran input (strategies for success) into the intervention delivered in aim 3. Aim 1: In a national longitudinal cohort of veterans with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes receiving care in the VHA, we will test the association of patient portal feature use with improvements in physiologic measures of control (HbA1c, LDL, and blood pressure) and whether the association differs for patients with mental health conditions or those in rural areas. Aim 2: Our goal is to collect data on at least 200 patients with good glycemic (HbA1c) control (cases) and at least 200 with poor control (controls). Using surveys, secure message coding, and in-depth semi-structured interviews with a subset of about 40-50 patients (approximately 20-25 from each of the above groups), we will examine differences in portal feature use, communication with the clinical team (information sharing, information seeking, socio-emotional exchange), and in sharing information from their portals with family and/or non-VA providers. Aim 3: We will conduct a small-scale experiment, using a randomized encouragement design, to test the feasibility of engaging veterans in a supported adoption intervention to promote effective MHV use, in a sample of 200 veterans with diabetes with or without comorbid mental health diagnoses. Participants randomized in the encouragement arm will receive additional support, such as a mailing, one-on-one and group sessions, and follow-up support. Those in the comparison condition will receive a mailing with only the goal setting content. Findings: There are no findings yet. Impact: This research will help clarify which portal features are associated with a greater likelihood of achieving controlled diabetes outcomes, and whether those features benefit all veterans with diabetes equally, or whether the overall effect masks group-level differences which must be accounted for in order to optimize the quality of care for all. These findings will be of critical importance not only to VA, but to other health care systems as well that are currently implementing PHR portals, and that serve patient populations faced with complex, chronic health care needs.

Abstract:	Starr County is a poor Texas-Mexico border community that is 98% Mexican American and has the highest diabetes-related death rate in Texas. In previous Starr County studies, we tested interventions culturally tailored for Spanish-speaking Mexican Americans diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Each study participant was supported by a family member who also received program benefits; 70% of these supporters did not have diabetes. Compared to the control group, fewer non-diabetic supporters in the experimental group converted to diabetes by 12 months post study entry. The primary purpose of the proposed study is to test the effectiveness of our culturally tailored DSME intervention that will be adapted for preventing, or at least delaying, diabetes onset in Mexican Americans with prediabetes. The intervention will involve 1) 12 two-hour weekly group educational sessions that emphasize eating and preparing healthy Mexican American foods and increasing physical activity; 2) 15 two-hour bi-weekly/monthly support group sessions on problem solving the barriers to adopting healthier lifestyles; and 3) three booster sessions held at 6-month intervals. We will integrate aspects of the Diabetes Prevention Program, as well as motivational interviewing, and prior to intervention testing, we will conduct focus groups with key individuals in Starr County to confirm the strategy and obtain community support. Intervention effectiveness will be examined using a randomized, repeated measures, pretest/posttest control group design, with an "enhanced" usual care control group. We will enroll 300 Mexican Americans with verified prediabetes from rosters of ongoing Starr County genetic studies. Groups of 10 will be constituted according to the area of the county in which people live; each group will be randomly assigned to experimental or control conditions. Growth curve analysis, using multilevel models, will be used to compare intervention effects on health outcomes over time. We hypothesize that participants in the experimental group, compared to the control group, will have better health outcomes (A1C, FBG, lipids, BP, physical activity, dietary intake, and anthropometric variables [BMI, waist circumference]) at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline, as well as lower rates of converting to T2DM (OGTT) by 36 months. This study is a significant step in our plan to develop effective culturally tailored health programs for populations at high risk for T2DM.

Abstract:	The proposed project will build on a well-established collaboration between researchers at the NYU School of Medicine, Health First (the largest Medicaid insurer in NYC), New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, clinical practices, and community partners to promote diabetes prevention among NYC South Asians. The goal of this study is to test the effectiveness and assess the implementation process of an integrated intervention to support weight loss for South Asian patients at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in primary care settings. The integrated intervention has two components: an electronic health record (EHR)-based component to increase screening and identification of South Asian patients who are at risk of T2DM; and 2) a registry-driven community health worker (CHW)-led health coaching component. Using a stepped-wedge design, we will implement the study in 25 NYC primary care practice (PCPs) sites enrolling 2,840 South Asian patients at risk for T2DM. The project has two specific aims. First, we will test the effectiveness of an integrated EHR-based intervention (i.e., an alert to screen at-risk patients and a registry function to track outcomes) plus CHW-led coaching of registered patients compared with usual care. The primary outcome is >5% weight loss among South Asian patients at risk for T2DM. Second, using a mixed-methods approach and the RE-AIM (reach, efficacy/effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) evaluation framework, we will systematically assess the implementation process and delineate factors that influence adoption, sustainability, and scalability of an integrated EHR-CHW intervention within applied practice settings. The integrated EHR-CHW protocol will support team-based care by allowing for feedback between providers and CHWs, who will be providing health education to participants while actively participating in patient management with providers.

Abstract:	The deterioration in diabetes self-management (DSM) and metabolic control associated with the adolescent developmental period is well known. African American adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at even higher risk for such problems. Research has shown that parenting behaviors such as parental monitoring of adolescent completion of daily diabetes care are critical predictors of youth DSM. Low levels of parental monitoring are even more likely to result in poor DSM among youth with T1D from minority or low-income homes. Few studies targeting adolescents have demonstrated that behavioral interventions can improve DSM or metabolic control, and no clinical trials have focused exclusively on African American youth. Furthermore, there have been no published clinical trials of interventions that have targeted parental monitoring of daily diabetes care as a means of improving DSM in adolescents. Computer-delivered, brief interventions have shown promising effects in a number of areas of behavioral health care and may also increase the accessibility of behavioral health interventions to minority families. Our group has recently conducted a pilot efficacy trial to test a brief, three-session computer intervention aimed at increasing parental motivation for supervision and monitoring among caregivers of young African American adolescents who are beginning to transition to independent self-care. Although the intervention was designed for delivery in diabetes clinics at regularly scheduled appointments, for the purpose of our efficacy pilot, it was delivered either in the clinic or in the home if the family missed their scheduled clinic appointment. Results from the efficacy study suggested that caregivers who received the intervention had significantly higher monitoring of their adolescent's daily diabetes management. Adolescents whose caregivers received the intervention had significant improvements in metabolic control compared to controls. The purpose of the proposed study is to conduct a multicenter, randomized effectiveness trial of the intervention with 212 African American adolescents with T1D and their primary caregivers recruited from pediatric endocrinology clinics across the United States. A hybrid 1 design will be used, allowing implementation science questions about barriers/facilitators to intervention adoption in real-world pediatric diabetes care clinics to be addressed. Caregiver-adolescent dyads will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms: caregiver motivational computer intervention for parental monitoring of diabetes care or caregiver attention control. The intervention will be delivered at three consecutive clinic appointments occurring over 12 months but will only be delivered in the diabetes clinic to determine if the intervention can improve DSM and health outcomes under real-world, effectiveness conditions. Dose effects and moderators of treatment outcomes will also be evaluated. If successful, the intervention has the potential to improve health outcomes and to contribute to the integration of behavioral health interventions into routine medical care in a vulnerable population of youth.

Abstract:	Type 2 diabetes affects over 13 million women in the US. Lifestyle programs to improve weight management, diet, and physical activity can prevent type 2 diabetes, are recommended for high-risk adults, and are increasingly available in health care delivery systems. Yet, while prior research has focused on the efficacy and effectiveness of lifestyle programs, little research has examined factors associated with patient engagement in lifestyle programs in real-world clinical settings. Low program participation and high attrition may contribute to poorer health outcomes for patients. Research on patient engagement is especially important for women with a history of gestational diabetes, who face markedly higher risk for type 2 diabetes. To advance the field of diabetes prevention and improve health care delivery for individuals at high risk, the overall objective of this proposal is to identify patient characteristics associated with engagement in an effective lifestyle program offered on behalf of an integrated health care delivery system to diverse women with a recent history of gestational diabetes. The project aims to determine patient characteristics that identify subgroups at risk for poor patient engagement (aim 1), and to develop meaningful descriptive profiles of these subgroups (aim 2). This secondary analysis leverages a unique source of electronic health record and patient-reported information. Results may creatively inform the future design of targeted outreach and curriculum materials to maximize program participation, with the ultimate goal of improving health in a young and diverse population at high risk for type 2 diabetes.

Abstract:	The Diabetes Prevention Program was a landmark randomized controlled trial that demonstrated the efficacy of a structured and comprehensive lifestyle intervention in preventing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Due to its large success, it was adapted for use in community settings by changing the intensive, individualized (one-on-one) lifestyle intervention to a facilitated, group-based intervention (Group Lifestyle BalanceTM [GLB]). While the GLB program has been associated with modest improvements in weight management and a reduced incidence of T2D in various community-based settings, reach has been limited. Health care system settings hold great potential for implementing behavioral lifestyle interventions due to the clinical resources and access to patients at risk for T2D. Natural experiments resulting from the spontaneous and organic implementation of evidence-based interventions, such as GLB, into a real-world clinical practice provide a rare and exciting opportunity to examine effectiveness in a truly pragmatic context. In the proposed study, Evaluation of a Lifestyle Intervention Adopted for Clinical Practice for Diabetes Prevention (ELEVATE-DP), we seek to evaluate the GLB program after its integration within a large, health care delivery system, Sutter Health (SH) of Northern California. SH is a mixed-payer environment and operates as a fee-for-service organization, much like the U.S. health care system as a whole. In 2010, two of the five regional affiliates independently launched GLB programs. This allows for the unique opportunity to rigorously evaluate the real-world effectiveness of the GLB program after integration within a health care system, with high potential for the generalizability of findings to other similar health systems in the U.S. This study will employ a rigorous mixed-methods evaluation approach, using a large, comprehensive electronic health records (EHR) system, GLB program records, and prospectively collected primary data from past and present GLB administrators, facilitators, and participants, as well as eligible non-participants. We will use the EHR to retrospectively identify GLB participants (N=5,000) and a matched usual care cohort (non-GLB participants; N=10,000) between 2010 and 2016, and will add four years of additional data (2017-2020). The specific aims are to 1) evaluate the clinical effectiveness of GLB relative to usual care; 2) evaluate the impact of GLB on health care resource utilization and costs relative to usual care, including a formal cost-effectiveness analysis; and 3) evaluate the implementation and fidelity of GLB within and across SH regional divisions and clinics using a comparative mixed-methods process evaluation. This study will identify important barriers to, and facilitators of, translating an efficacious diabetes prevention intervention into routine clinical practice outside of a research setting.

Abstract:	Large randomized trials have found that intensive lifestyle interventions (ILI) and metformin are safe and effective treatment options for preventing diabetes among adults with prediabetes. However, these treatments are rarely used, and little existing research has focused on patient-centered approaches for promoting their use. A large body of evidence suggests that risk communication interventions are a promising method for motivating patients to adopt diverse preventive health behaviors. But this approach has not been definitively studied in the context of diabetes prevention. Therefore, the content, structure, and process for communicating diabetes risk to adults with prediabetes is not known. We plan to address this critical knowledge gap by developing and pilot testing the Diabetes Risk Education and Communication Trial (DiRECT) intervention among primary care patients with prediabetes. This novel intervention, delivered by medical assistants before patients' routinely scheduled office visits, consists of the following three components intended to promote initiation of ILI and metformin: 1) a prediabetes decision aid focused on diabetes risk and treatment options for preventing diabetes, 2) a "think aloud" exercise, and 3) formulating a preliminary treatment plan. Previous studies report that medical assistants can improve uptake of some preventive health services in primary care, which may also be true for ILI and metformin. We will test this hypothesis by completing the following specific aims. In aim 1 we will develop the DiRECT intervention using materials that our group has created and pilot tested in the target population. We will engage an expert advisory panel of stakeholders in diabetes prevention, who will help develop the intervention so that it can be widely disseminated if found to be effective. Aim 2 will evaluate the effects of the DiRECT intervention on patients' perceived risk of developing diabetes and their intention to adopt treatment, in addition to other factors that may impact treatment decisions. Aim 3 is a pilot randomized trial of DiRECT vs. usual care in 80 primary care patients with prediabetes (40 in each arm). This pilot pragmatic trial will estimate the preliminary effects of DiRECT on the following 3-month outcomes: initiation of ILI and/or metformin (primary), adherence to these treatment(s), and weight loss. We will also examine the intervention's acceptability, impact on clinical workflows, and costs. We hypothesize that the empirically developed DiRECT intervention will improve the accuracy of participants' risk perceptions and increase their initiation of treatments to prevent diabetes. This study will be conducted in a large community health center, in which 90% of patients with prediabetes are racial/ethnic minorities and 83% live in poverty. Our proposal is responsive to PAR-15-158 by 1) including a low-income, diverse population; 2) using medical assistants, a workforce that is ubiquitous and therefore scalable to most primary care settings; and 3) leveraging an existing data infrastructure to pragmatically assess participants' eligibility and collect their clinical data.

Abstract:	Background: Diabetes affects 25% of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients and is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Self-management, including healthy eating, being physically active, and taking medications, is critical to preventing diabetes complications, but many veterans do not adhere to self-management recommendations. Enhancing the quality and quantity of existing social support resources is a promising strategy to improve self-management among veterans, as self-management behaviors are influenced by a patient's social network. However, little is known about veterans' existing social support resources for self-management, how to best leverage social support to facilitate self-management, and whether there are differences by gender. Objectives: The proposed research will adapt and pilot test a virtual intervention that includes veterans with diabetes and support persons, which aims to reduce unsupportive and enhance supportive behaviors to facilitate veterans' self-management. Aim 1 is to characterize social support resources, perceptions of supportive and unsupportive behaviors related to diabetes self-management, and facilitators and barriers to engaging in a partnered self-management intervention. Aim 2 is to identify support person perceptions of supportive and unsupportive behaviors for veterans' self-management and facilitators and barriers to engaging in a partnered self-management intervention. Aim 3 is to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical improvement of a partnered diabetes self-management intervention in a single-arm pilot trial (n=20 men, n=20 women) employing a mixed-methods approach. Methods: Aim 1 will utilize individual qualitative telephone interviews with veterans (n=32) to characterize social support resources for self-management. Aim 2 will involve individual qualitative telephone interviews with support persons identified by veterans in aim 1 (e.g., spouses, adult children, and friends; n=16) to understand their perceptions of helpful and harmful support. Lastly, aim 3 will use both qualitative and quantitative methods to pilot test modifications to an existing partnered self-management intervention and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical improvement in self-management behaviors and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) overall and by gender. Impact: Diabetes is highly prevalent among veterans with profound impacts on health and wellbeing. Innovative, veteran-centric interventions are needed to improve diabetes self-management. The proposed research has the potential to fill this gap, particularly for women veterans who are often included in very limited numbers in VA intervention studies. If effective, this strategy could be tailored to other chronic diseases or disease prevention. The project aims align with VA's Blueprint for Excellence strategies of anticipating and meeting the unique needs of veterans; delivering high-quality, veteran-centered care; and advancing personalized, proactive, and patient-driven care.

Abstract:	Diabetes, a chronic disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality, is disproportionately represented in African Americans. Diabetes self-management education and support (DSME/S) is crucial to delaying or preventing disease progression; however, lack of access to proper health care due to financial, cultural, knowledge, geographic, or physical barriers places this disadvantaged population at further risk for poor disease outcomes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies have shown promise in improving health outcomes, but have important limitations for management of this complex disease. For example, they can lack personalization to users' cultural, health, and educational needs. Some technologies, like apps and wearables, require high self-motivation, health literacy, and knowledge for successful utilization. Moreover, most technological solutions do not support the patient-provider collaboration critical to sustained behavioral change and ongoing diabetes care over a lifetime. We propose to build an artificially intelligent diabetes assistant (AIDA), a chatbot-powered telehealth platform that is designed to provide highly interactive, automated diabetes self-care support and facilitate remote patient-provider collaboration. Through dynamic, instant-messaging based conversations, AIDA will provide interpretive feedback of blood glucose levels, conduct assessments (e.g., medication adherence, mood), and deliver real-time, culturally sensitive interventions using smartphone technology. AI technology will enable increasingly targeted, individualized interventions. Integration into a larger communication platform will allow providers to remotely assess, monitor, and intervene using real-time patient data collected by the chatbot. AIDA will be a low-cost, smart-phone based, ecologically relevant tool that is highly innovative, engaging, and impactful. This research will be conducted in collaboration with urban-based community clinics and University of North Carolina researchers specializing in diabetes, health disparities, African American population, telehealth, and behavioral change interventions. In this phase I SBIR project, we will address the following specific aims: 1) conduct focus groups and interviews with African American diabetes patients, their caregivers, and diabetes care providers to collect input on system features, usability design, and messaging content; 2) develop three AIDA health modules (glucose monitoring, medication adherence, healthy coping) and a virtual health library; and 3) examine the feasibility and acceptability of the new technology. A future phase II application will build on phase I success by creating additional health modules (nutrition, exercise, and risk management) and conducting a clinical trial comparing the efficacy of traditional DSME/S to AIDA support on health and disease outcomes. We envision that AIDA will be marketed to diabetes care providers, with revenue generated through licensing fees. If found effective, AIDA could be deployed across the national network of diabetes providers/programs, potentially improving health equity in diabetes care.

Abstract:	The overall goal of the proposed research is to provide evidence for individualizing care for older adults with prediabetes (PD) and diabetes (DM) by investigating their risks and development of CVD and disability. Older adults with PD and DM suffer disproportionality from diabetes morbidity, particularly CVD and also disability, an outcome that really matters to patients. Our study will use longitudinal data to observe CVD and disability development in PD/DM patients over time. These analyses will lead to practical population-based methods to stratify people with DM for their individual risks of CVD and disability, helping to individualize care. Our research will test whether CVD and disability development in PD/DM follows several distinct trajectories with different predictors and risks that will differ by age. We hypothesize that CVD explains the risk of disability more in people with PD/DM < 75 than in those older, and that we can develop risk models to better guide clinical decision making. The specific aims are to 1), investigate heterogeneity in the risk of developing CVD in adults from middle to old age aging with PD/DM; 2) investigate heterogeneity in their risk of developing disability; and 3) specify risk models for CVD and disability in people aging with PD/DM, including people with diverse ethnicities and the oldest old. To accomplish our goal, we will perform secondary data analysis of the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), a nationally representative health interview survey that has been collecting data for over 20 years. Besides extensive health interview information, the HRS also features biomarkers (HbA1c, total and HDL cholesterol, CRP, cystatin), physical assessment information (blood pressure, weight, waist circumference, walking speed), prescription medications for a subsample of participants, and Medicare claims linkages. The HRS allows us to evaluate key variables longitudinally, to account for ethnicity and cohort changes in people aging with PD/DM, and to consider management and its changes over many years. The HRS has enrolled nearly 6,000 people with diabetes aged 51 to over 100. We will employ sophisticated statistical analyses as important tools to test our ideas about dynamic processes, time-dependent risks, and age-cohort differences. We believe this work will provide evidence to guide individualized DM care for older patients and will lead to risk models for outcomes that include people of advanced age, diverse ethnicities, and complex health status.

Abstract:	The Marshallese are a Pacific Islander population experiencing significant health disparities in type 2 diabetes and associated risk factors. Marshallese and other Pacific Islanders are underrepresented in all types of health research. A lack of research has perpetuated disparities by limiting the availability and quality of information that informs patients', caregivers', and providers' decisions about the best way to prevent diabetes. The primary question from Marshallese patients and caregivers addressed by this research is the following: "What can I do to prevent diabetes, and how can I help those I care about prevent diabetes?" To address this question, we collaboratively reviewed potential strategies and selected comparators and outcomes that are meaningful to stakeholders. The Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle Intervention (DPP-LI) is an evidence-based program that has been shown to reduce weight, lower BMI, lower HbA1c, lower blood pressure, improve eating habits, and increase physical activity. While the DPP-LI has been effective at improving outcomes among the general population, among racial and ethnic populations, and across multiple settings, its effectiveness has not been adequately tested among Pacific Islanders in particular. The traditional DPP-LI has been tested among Pacific Islander participants with moderately positive outcomes; however, the results were hampered by attrition. A culturally adapted Pacific DPP-LI, which included half of the contact hours of the traditional DPP-LI, has shown positive results in Pacific Islander participants; however, the Pacific DPP-LI study did not include a control or comparison group, which left important gaps in knowledge about its comparative effectiveness with the traditional DPP-LI. Our overall goal is to reduce disparities related to type 2 diabetes within the Marshallese community. The proposed study is conducted in a real world setting and will determine whether the Pacific DPP-LI or the traditional DPP-LI is more effective in achieving clinically meaningful, patient centered outcomes with Marshallese participants. The proposed research is significant to a broad range of people and groups who have a stake in preventing diabetes and improving the health of Marshallese and other Pacific Islander communities. All aspects of this proposal have been collaboratively developed by both Marshallese and non-Marshallese stakeholders and researchers at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, with the goal of integrating indigenous Pacific knowledge and values with Western knowledge and the highest methodological standards.

Abstract:	The landmark 2002 Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Study showed that either an intensive lifestyle modification intervention program of diet and exercise or taking a medication called metformin greatly reduced diabetes risk in patients at high risk of developing diabetes, compared to "usual care." The impact of this study was enormous. "Prediabetes" affects approximately one-third of adults in the United States. Although the DPP study was published a decade ago, it is still unclear how to implement these potentially effective but costly programs in such a large population. This PCORI-funded study identified a way to focus these programs on patients who could benefit the most from the interventions. As part of a PCORI funded evaluation looking at how the effects of medical treatments vary across patients, the researchers performed analyses on individual patient data from clinical trials, including a re-analysis of the DPP study. The project team's published results from the DPP using risk predictive models, which take multiple patient characteristics into account at the same time, showed that a patient's degree of benefit from metformin or from the lifestyle intervention was distributed very unevenly. Patients at low risk of developing diabetes received very little benefit from either intervention in terms of reduced diabetes incidence. However, patients at high risk benefited tremendously, and much more than reflected by the average trial results. Health systems are confronted with a growing number of patients with prediabetes, but they lack the capacity to treat everyone. While there is a low risk of medical harm resulting from the lifestyle intervention, it is an extremely intensive undertaking for both the patient and the health system. The team's research results provide valuable information to help providers and health systems prioritize patients most likely to benefit, such as those at especially high risk of developing diabetes. Yet to influence decision making, this information and risk model needs to be moved from the pages of the medical literature to the clinics and providers at the point of care. The aim of this dissemination and implementation project is to incorporate the project team's DPP benefit prediction model into an electronic health record (EHR)-based tool easily accessible at the point of care, adapting it as necessary using stakeholder input. In this way, the researchers will put into place a clear and clinically actionable understanding of the variation in the benefits of diabetes prevention interventions. The project team will also disseminate the EHR-based tool to approximately 50 clinic sites within two AMGA member health care provider organizations (Mercy Health Systems and Premier Medical Associates) and evaluate its use and effects.

Abstract:	Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) requires life-long insulin therapy to treat high blood sugars. Without insulin, children die. T1DM is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Unfortunately, Canada has one of the highest rates. Long-term diabetes can lead to several health problems, including poor blood flow to the feet, kidneys, and heart. This can result in health problems including the need to amputate feet, kidney failure needing dialysis, or even early death. Several research studies have shown that keeping the blood sugars as close to the non-diabetes range reduces the risk of these health problems. However, almost normal blood sugars can increase the chance of going to the hospital because of very low blood sugar. One way of keeping blood sugars in "tight control" is to use an insulin pump or a device that provides small quantities of insulin around the clock and extra when one eats. These devices are expensive and so all the provinces of Canada help families with children with T1DM to be able to afford the pump ($7000) and annual supplies ($4000). It would appear that for families of lower income and education (lower socioeconomic status [SES]) their children often do less well using the pump compared to families of higher SES in Ontario. This project is about looking at how well children in Quebec do with their pumps because Quebec covers all costs for the pump, unlike Ontario where only a portion of the supplies are paid for. We believe that full coverage for blood sugar testing strips and other supplies may allow all families in Quebec to do well and avoid going to hospital. We will also be looking at how children with T1DM on the pump in Quebec and Manitoba do overall with regards to hospital visits compared to children in those provinces not using the pump. The reason for this study is to try to ensure that all children with T1DM are able to stay as healthy as possible and to optimize how we provide tools and supports for care.

Abstract:	Type 2 diabetes is the sixth-leading cause of death in the U.S., largely as a result of cardiometabolic complications such as coronary heart disease (CHD). T2D ranges in prevalence from under 4% to almost 18% in counties across the country. The geographic variation can be explained in part by several place-level contextual factors, but the proportion of variance explained by county-level indicators differs regionally. For example, while a combination of nine county-level measures of mainly socioeconomic, race/ethnicity, and built environmental features explain up to 94% of the variation in T2D prevalence in the Midwest, these same factors explain very little variation in Mid-Atlantic counties, including those in Pennsylvania (PA). Our study focuses on four contextual domains that we hypothesize impact T2D and CHD outcomes in PA: chronic environmental contamination, social environment, food environment, and physical activity environment (both utilitarian [walkability] and recreational physical activity). We will evaluate multiple mechanisms through which these factors could impact T2D and CHD. Potential pathways include the influence of physical and social environmental contextual factors on stress, sleep quality, mental health, health care system effectiveness, and obesity-related behaviors. Multilevel studies using nested geographies at several scales are necessary to disentangle the role of contextual and individual factors associated with T2D and its consequences. Thus, we will conduct two nested multilevel studies of T2D and CHD onset and control of T2D. The setting for each is the large, diverse region of PA served by the Geisinger Health System, allowing us to link contextual factors to the wealth of individual-level data contained in electronic health records (EHR). Each will evaluate contextual main effects and then mediation and moderation of these effects. The two connected studies represent an efficient, big data approach to research while simultaneously offering a deep contextual examination of T2D and CHD. The first (38-county EHR study [38co-EHR]) will use existing data on 30,000 patients with T2D and 200,000 patients without T2D. This longitudinal study will be conducted in 38 counties comparing associations in counties and smaller, nested geographies (multi-scale) in relation to T2D onset and control and CHD onset. The second (4-county Behavior and Biomarker Study [4co-BBS]) will study T2D control in four of these counties with high and low T2D burden, evaluating cross-sectional associations in smaller geographies. 4co-BBS will supplement EHR measures and secondary contextual data with primary data collection using saliva cortisol, direct observation of communities, and patient questionnaires. The 4co-BBS study will broaden the scope of pathways examined, collecting data on health behaviors, health system distrust, and community perceptions. Identifying the contextual factors with the greatest influence on the prevalence of T2D and T2D cardiometabolic complications in PA is critical to understanding regional differences and will inform the development of targeted primary and secondary prevention strategies.

Abstract:	Diabetes prevalence has more than doubled in the past two decades, and now nearly 1 in 10 Americans has diabetes. After a similar steep increase, obesity rates among US adults have been stable in the past 10 years, but strong disparities persist and rates are still rising in some groups. Prevention efforts to date have mostly focused on individual-level risk factors. However, a growing body of research has linked diabetes, obesity, and other cardiometabolic risk factors to a range of community characteristics, suggesting that environmental factors can have a direct beneficial or deleterious influence on disease risk. Numerous studies have observed significant and plausible associations between diabetes and obesity prevalence and attributes of the social and physical environment. Some of these community factors are amenable to intervention, yet the true magnitude of their relative contributions remains unclear, especially after adjusting for population characteristics. In response to FOA-DP-17-001, we aim to collaborate with other funded centers to examine modifiable community characteristics that may together explain stark disparities in diabetes, obesity, and other cardiometabolic conditions in the United States using ecologic and multi-level study designs. Specifically, we aim to use county-level prevalence data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and individual-level electronic medical record data from a very large national Veterans Administration (VA) cohort (~4.6 million patients) to examine the relationship between key community factors pertaining to the food and housing environment and 3 outcomes: diabetes, obesity, and discordance between county-level diabetes and obesity prevalence, an approach that allows us to examine unique contextual risk factors for each condition. Expanding on prior work, we propose developing novel community measures that may contribute to diabetes and obesity disparities. Our primary food environment measures to be refined, shared with other centers, and analyzed pertain to relative "food swamp" measures (neighborhoods in which cheap, energy-dense, and pre-prepared food is a dominant option). Our primary housing environment measures to be refined, shared, and analyzed are "housing cost burden" measures. We will use causal inference techniques to strengthen our multilevel analyses (e.g., instrumental variable analysis and negative control outcomes). We will also perform causal mediation analysis and primary data collection to examine potential mechanistic pathways on our main study datasets. Primary data will be collected through a planned social determinant of health survey in partnership with the New York City Health Department. Capitalizing on (1) the breadth of expertise among New York University researchers in the areas of health surveillance, food and housing policy research, and causal inquiry methods; (2) access to a very large cohort of VA patients; and (3) our demonstrated track record of leadership and collaboration in other CDC-funded networks, this study offers a powerful opportunity to identify community disease determinants for use in policy and systems change to reduce disparities.

Abstract:	Deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) have begun to increase in the US after decades of decline. Although the reasons underlying this increase in CVD deaths are unclear, the prevention, detection, and optimal treatment of CVD risk factors (i.e., diabetes and hypertension) will be essential for preventing any further increases in CVD mortality. Currently, 14% of adults in the US have diabetes, of which 1 in 3 is undiagnosed, and 29% of adults have hypertension. However, stark disparities exist in the CVD risk factor burden, particularly by social determinants of health. These determinants are key contributors to the development of diabetes and hypertension. Yet, they have largely been omitted from clinical practice and decision making. There is increasing awareness of the influence of social determinants on health outcomes, but it is not clear exactly which factors should be assessed or how to integrate this information into current practice. Social determinants of health are extensive, so it is important to characterize those that are likely to have the greatest influence on the prevention, treatment, and control of diabetes and hypertension and may be used to inform the development of targeted programs and policies. We propose to investigate the community and individual social determinants that contribute to a greater burden of diabetes and hypertension in the southeastern US by leveraging national databases, the Medicare claims administrative database and the infrastructure of a prospective cohort study, the NIH-funded Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, that enrolled 30,239 middle-aged and older adults in 2003-07. We will build upon these resources to address the following aims: 1) determine the association of county-level social determinants of health with the county-level prevalence and incidence of diabetes and hypertension, separately, in the southeastern US; 2) evaluate the association of county-level social determinants of health with the county-level prevalence and incidence of diabetes and hypertension, separately, among older adults in the southeastern US using the Medicare database; and 3) evaluate the association of county-level and individual-level social determinants of health with individual-level prevalent and incident diabetes and hypertension, separately, among REGARDS participants in the southeastern US. This proposal will prioritize those social determinants of health that are associated with a greater burden of diabetes and hypertension in the southeastern US and help guide prevention programs and interventions to reduce this excess risk.

Abstract:	Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are distinct clinical conditions with different etiologies, ages of onset, management strategies, risk factors, and outcomes. Currently, the data sources that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) relies upon to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and incidence are unable to reliably distinguish between types of diabetes. Most of the large federal surveys used for diabetes surveillance have not included questions on diabetes type, and few studies have reported survey-based algorithms for identifying diabetes type. None have compared survey-based identification algorithms with a gold standard case ascertainment in order to validate survey-based assignment of diabetes type. Methods for distinguishing between diabetes types in electronic health records (EHR) data have been tested for children and adults, but additional validation work is needed. Our approach to improving diabetes surveillance in these two areas is based on an integrated study design whereby survey data for diabetes patients are linked with data from their EHR and a gold standard case ascertainment derived from chart review. We will select a diverse sample of diabetes patients that is designed and powered to assess algorithm validity for subpopulations defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We will use rigorous questionnaire development methods to build on items used in previous surveys, cognitively test the new survey module to optimize wording and question order, field the survey using data collection methods similar to established CDC surveys, and analyze the responses relative to a gold standard classification of diabetes type. In addition, we will develop and validate against the gold standard EHR-based algorithms, including a modeling approach that produces a parsimonious rule-based algorithm for determining diabetes type based on the most important clinical variables, and a machine learning approach that uses the gold standard dataset as a starting point to identify implicit patterns that distinguish T1DM and T2DM.

Abstract:	Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost-effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support, given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity, applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing Healthy SMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient-entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population.

Abstract:	We propose a research study that would greatly expand the opportunity for students to be involved in research, contribute to their knowledge about the health care service needs of rural populations, and stimulate research at our university about health care for minority ethnic/racial rural populations, especially rural Latinos. The proposed study addresses the problem of health disparities among rural populations as a whole, and among rural Latino residents specifically. The U.S. Latino population is growing at a rapid pace. As a group, they are at a high risk for developing diabetes. Compared to other groups, they have high percentages of overweight or obesity, which are among the risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). The complications of diabetes are serious and costly to the patient and the health care system as a whole. To date, little is known about the potential impact of accountable care organizations (ACOs) on ethnic/racial disparities in health care (Pollack & Armstrong, 2011). Knowing how ACOs affect these disparities is particularly essential because some minority groups, such as Latinos, African Americans, and Native Americans, are more concentrated in rural areas (Institute of Medicine, 2005). We propose a longitudinal study, the purpose of which is to 1) compare health disparities and patient outcomes of rural Latino older adult patients diagnosed with diabetes to their non-Latino white counterparts and 2) ascertain the impact of ACO participation by rural primary care providers (along with other factors) on rural Latino older adult patients. The study has two goals: (aim 1) to measure the disparities in diabetes-related hospitalization rates between rural Latino older adult patients of Medicare ACOs and rural non-Latino white older adult patients; and (aim 2) to identify factors related to reduced disparities in diabetes-related hospitalization rates of rural Latino older adult patients, including RHC participation in a Medicare ACO. We will apply a pre-post design treating Medicare ACO participation as an intervention. The project will use data for a four-year period before the Medicare ACOs began (2008-2011) and a four-year period afterwards (2012-2015). The project will proceed in 3 major phases as follows: 1) collecting, merging, and organizing secondary data from multiple sources; 2) researching and constructing variables to include in the analyses; and 3) conducting univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. The study will contribute to rural health research by adding to the knowledge about 1) the factors that contribute to minimizing diabetes-related health disparities of rural Latino adults, 2) the diabetes preventive care effectiveness of ACOs, and 3) the types of ACOs most beneficial to rural Latino patients.

Abstract:	Nearly one in three Indian adults has hypertension and many more have pre-hypertension. In rural India, roughly three-quarters of adults with hypertension never receive treatment, and 90% of individuals receiving treatment for hypertension fail to achieve adequate blood pressure control. The current Indian public health care system is neither oriented nor equipped to process the total caseload of hypertension. This is due in part to poor coordination across facilities at different levels of the health care system and lack of mechanisms to efficiently follow up with or refer patients, resulting in a mismatch between patient needs and treatment availability as well as inefficient use of limited health care resources. To address these gaps in the health care delivery model, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Public Health Foundation of India, and Emory University will partner to develop an Integrated Tracking, Referral, Electronic Decision Support and Care Coordination (I-TREC) package focused on hypertension and its most frequent comorbidity, diabetes. This multi-component package will improve coordination of care across various levels of the health care facility hierarchy and will include electronic data capture, electronic decision support, and care coordination training for health care professionals; text messaging to patients for appointments and disease management advice; facility-level retrieval of patient history and inventory needs; and health administration monitoring of data across levels. Our objectives are to (1) adapt I-TREC for implementation within the public health care system with input of local, national, and international stakeholders; (2) implement I-TREC across all 15 health facilities comprising the government health care system in Banga Block (sub-district level administrative unit) of Punjab state, India; and (3) evaluate I-TREC using a quasi-experimental design by comparing performance of key indicators in Banga Block with another non-neighboring but comparable block in the same district. The proposed T4 intervention promises to consolidate previously proven strategies at single levels of the health care hierarchy into a coordinated system of care delivery that relies entirely on the existing health care workforce. Findings will have the potential to revolutionize care for deadly chronic diseases across India in the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach patients who rely heavily on the government health care system and generate a scalable model that can be applied to other similar settings.

Abstract:	Patient-physician racial discordance is strongly associated with patient dissatisfaction and mistrust in physicians, which is further associated with poor treatment adherence and suboptimal health care utilization. This poses serious public health challenges because approximately 80-90% of black patients see physicians from different racial groups. Patient dissatisfaction and mistrust have been recently found to be particularly magnified when physicians hold high levels of automatic, implicit bias toward black Americans, suggesting that physicians' implicit racial bias impacts physician communication behaviors during medical interactions and ultimately black patient outcomes. The overall goal of this research is to identify physicians' communication behaviors during medical interactions that are associated with physicians' implicit racial bias and black patients' immediate outcomes (satisfaction, trust) as well as clinically important longer-term outcomes (adherence, health care utilization). To achieve this goal, we target medical interactions involving black patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) because nonadherence in black patients with T2DM is particularly prevalent. Additionally, the patient-physician communication quality has been found to predict patient adherence to T2DM treatment regimens. We will use a mixed-methods design that integrates the strengths of inductive reasoning to explore which physician communication behaviors during medical interactions matter from black patients' perspectives and deductive reasoning to identify theoretically and clinically important behaviors. Our aims are (aim 1) to explore which physician communication behaviors during medical interactions are perceived negatively or positively by black patients and why; (aim 2) to identify which physician communication behaviors identified in aim 1 are associated with physicians' implicit racial bias; and (aim 3) to examine how physicians' implicit racial bias impacts black patients' satisfaction, trust, adherence, and health care utilization through physicians' communication behaviors. We will use an innovative integration of multiple methods (interviews, video-recorded medical interactions, surveys, medical record reviews). Findings from this research will enable researchers to identify physician communication behaviors during medical interactions that are problematic and beneficial to the immediate and longer-term outcomes among black patients with T2DM. Such an ability is needed to develop personally tailored, targeted communication skills training and other interventions targeting patient-provider interactions to overcome racial disparities in diabetes treatment adherence, outcomes, and beyond. Additionally, upon completion of this project, we will have a Medical Interaction involving Black Patients Coding System (MIBPCS) that differs from prior patient-physician communication coding systems in that it (1) will focus on physicians' communication behaviors during medical interactions that can predict black patients' outcomes and (2) places an unprecedented importance on the patients' point of view.

Abstract:	Reducing adverse outcomes from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) requires optimal self-management and appropriate clinical care. Combining an evidence-based intervention to improve diabetes self-management with individually tailored patient navigation to improve appropriate clinical care holds great promise. Only one known randomized controlled trial has been tested that combines these two most essential components of diabetes control. That trial resulted in improvements to glycemic control, blood pressure, and diabetes self-management, but was implemented in a clinical setting. We aim to enhance this work by recruiting from and locating most research activities in community-based settings to ensure involvement of the most vulnerable, hardest to reach populations who may not be receiving regular health care and by leveraging community health workers and patient navigators, who are essential and sustainable outreach workers in health care professional shortage areas. We propose testing a refined intervention, "Community to Clinic Navigation" (CCN), shown to be promising, feasible, and acceptable in our pilot study. Given that Appalachian and rural residents maintain disproportionately high rates of T2DM and suffer tremendous burdens from diabetic complications, this setting provides a perfect opportunity to test the intervention with a hard-to-reach population while addressing health inequities. We will administer a 3-arm group randomized design including (1) Diabetes Self-management Program, DSMP only; (2) tailored Patient Navigation, PN only; and (3) the combined DSMP + PN: Community to Clinic Navigation program, CCN. Outcomes include biometrics (HbA1c, BMI, blood pressure, lipids, waist circumference); diabetes self-management and clinic attendance, as mediators of the primary outcomes; cost-effectiveness; and participant satisfaction. Persons with diabetes will be recruited through churches and other community venues. Our project leverages sustainable assets available in most health disparity communities--faith organizations, community centers, federally qualified health clinics, strong social ties, and talented local lay people who can be trained to educate and navigate those diagnosed with T2DM. Our sustained involvement in Appalachian Kentucky positions our team to appropriately and efficiently test this promising program with strong potential for future dissemination to other traditionally underserved environments.

Abstract:	In the United States (U.S.), more than 29 million Americans have diabetes, and approximately one-third of new diagnoses are among young adults ages 18-50. Women with diabetes in this age group are at risk of pregnancy complications secondary to elevated blood glucose, including spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preeclampsia, preterm birth, macrosomia, fetal malformation, and fetal programming for obesity and diabetes later in life. Women with diabetes can reduce these risks by preventing unintended pregnancies with contraception until glycemic control is optimized. However, despite the large and growing population of reproductive age women with diabetes, little data is available about their reproductive health behaviors to inform policy and practice. Guided by Pender's "Revised Health Promotion Model" and Brown and et al.'s "Socioeconomic Position and Health among Persons with Diabetes Mellitus" model, the proposed study will describe sociodemographic as well as cognitive and affective antecedents (hereafter referred to as "attitudinal factors" or "attitudes") to contraception use behavior by women with diabetes. Aim 1 is to conduct an analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) data set to provide descriptive statistics about the distribution of diagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and prediabetes (identified with biospecimens) by sociodemographic characteristics, including race/ethnicity, socioeconomic position, health insurance status, and access to health care. Aim 2 is to use Add Health data to describe contraception use behavior by women with diagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and prediabetes, and to test the hypothesis, based on Brown et al.'s theoretical model of health disparities, that sociodemographic characteristics and diabetes status are associated with use of effective contraception. Add Health is a nationally representative U.S. sample that is uniquely suited for analyzing reproductive age women with diabetes and their reproductive health behaviors. To describe attitudes associated with reproductive health behaviors, aim 3 is to conduct a survey with women with diabetes six weeks postpartum about their attitudes and perceptions of barriers, benefits, self-efficacy, and preferences concerning pregnancy planning and contraception. This knowledge is essential for meeting the contraception needs of the growing population of reproductive age women with diabetes.

Abstract:	In the U.S., approximately 40% of the population has some hyperglycemic condition. Worksite interventions offer a promising framework for delivering public health interventions to people with prediabetes, since worksites reach a large segment of the population for most of their adult life. The opportunity for long-term follow-up and support may be greater through worksites than through clinic-based programs. Worksite interventions that promote weight loss through lifestyle modification reduce risk for type 2 diabetes among those at high risk. However, there is heterogeneity in the weight loss response following a standard lifestyle intervention, and early non-response to treatment is an indicator of treatment success. Stepped, or augmented, care can be effective in promoting additional weight loss among early non-responders. Furthermore, effective treatments for weight loss maintenance, especially at the worksite, are not well known. Ongoing contact and support, frequent self-weighing, and skill building in problem solving and barrier reduction offer promise as intervention strategies for weight loss maintenance. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the standard 16-week, goal-based Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) intervention for diabetes prevention to an alternate version of the intervention (GLB+) that is restructured with training in cognitive and emotional agency for change, problem solving, and goal attainment. University employees who are at least 21 years old with prediabetes (n=236) will be recruited and receive the first 4 weeks of the standard GLB intervention. Participants who fail to achieve 2.5% weight loss at intervention week 5 will receive the GLB+ intervention for the remaining 12 weeks. The 16-week core intervention phase then will be followed by an 8-month extended intervention phase to promote weight loss maintenance. Following the core intervention phase, matched pairs of participants will be created based on gender and percent weight change from baseline. Each person in the pair will be randomly assigned to either the extended intervention phase of the standard GLB intervention or to the extended intervention phase of the GLB+ intervention. A 6-month no-contact maintenance phase will follow the extended intervention phase. The impact of the interventions on percent change in weight (primary outcome), fasting glucose, lipid panel, blood pressure, dietary intake, physical activity, quality of life, and constructs related to problem solving and goal setting will be determined at 4, 12, and 18 months. Cost-effectiveness analysis also will be conducted to determine if the benefits associated with weight change justify the costs associated with intervention augmentation. The proposed study will enable evaluation of a practical approach for a sustainable diabetes prevention program at a university worksite and the impact of augmented care on early non-response to treatment and on weight loss maintenance.

Abstract:	American Indian (Native) youth have the highest incidence and prevalence of pediatric type 2 diabetes of all racial/ethnic groups in the United States. Lifestyle modification has been shown to prevent type 2 diabetes among high-risk adults by up to 58%, including among Native populations, but similar efforts in Native youth have been largely unsuccessful. We recently developed a behavioral intervention for Native youth-parent dyads called Tribal Turning Point (TTP). In a randomized pilot study, we demonstrated feasibility of program delivery, acceptability by Native stakeholders, and significant treatment effects for multiple obesity measures. We now propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to rigorously evaluate the effect of TTP on diabetes risk factors in 300 overweight/obese Native youth aged 7-10 years who are living in urban or rural communities served by the Indian Health Services. Within each community, youth will be randomized to the TTP program or a general health and safety control program. The multi-component TTP intervention is a youth-centered adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Program designed to reduce diabetes risk factors by improving activity and dietary behaviors. The 12-month intervention includes 12 active learning group classes, 7 individual youth/parent motivational interviewing counseling sessions, and community-specific resource toolboxes. In this trial, we will assess the effect of TTP on anthropometric, metabolic, and behavioral risk factors for type 2 diabetes at the end of the intervention (12 months) and after 1 year of follow-up (24 months). With an eye toward widespread dissemination of the program, we will also collect qualitative data on factors related to participant engagement, program delivery, and potential for sustainability throughout the award period, which will guide future implementation efforts. The specific aims of our proposal are 1) evaluate the effect of TTP on anthropometric (primary: BMI; secondary: BMI z-score, waist circumference) and metabolic (primary: fasting insulin; secondary: hemoglobin A1c) diabetes risk factors at 12 and 24 months; 2) examine the effect of TTP on health behaviors (diet, physical activity) and the extent to which improvements in health behaviors mediate the effects of TTP on diabetes risk factors; and 3) explore individual, organizational, and community-level factors related to participant engagement, program implementation, and potential for sustained delivery.

Abstract:	The financial burden of medications is a significant barrier to medication adherence and subsequent diabetes control. Benefit designs that reduce copayments for services that are seen to be more cost-effective (known as "value-based insurance designs" or VBIDs) continue to capture the attention of public and private insurers, employers, and policy makers as a strategy to improve adherence and reduce long-term costs. While VBID programs that reduce copayments for chronic illness medications have been shown to have a positive short-term impact on medication adherence, we know less about long-term sustainability of clinical gains over time, particularly when incentives are eliminated. Also, little is known about which factors affect who participates and who benefits when VBID programs are introduced by a health plan in a real-world, multi-employer setting. This study will evaluate the provision and discontinuation of a real-world VBID program called the WellRx DrugRider--a zero copay drug benefit offered to engage patients more effectively in their self-care. To take advantage of this unique natural experiment, we will use a multi-method approach, including patient-mailed surveys; semi-structured interviews of patients, providers, and employers; and a quasi-experimental longitudinal study using pre-post with comparison group and patient-level interrupted time series with comparison series to evaluate the impact of WellRx among patients with diabetes. This study is motivated by four specific aims: (1) to examine determinants of decisions about WellRx participation among employers and patients with diabetes and assess differences in at-risk patient subgroups (e.g., race and socioeconomic status); (2) to examine changes in self-management, utilization and costs, and clinical outcomes (HbA1c, lipid, blood pressure control) over a 1-year baseline and up to 4-year follow-up, comparing patients whose employers offered the free program compared to propensity-matched patients whose employers did not; (3) to assess sustainability of outcomes following program discontinuation, comparing patients whose employers continue or choose to discontinue WellRx coverage in later follow-up years; and (4) to determine whether the changes observed in aims 2 and 3 differ by race/ethnicity, income, education attainment, or baseline nonadherence. The proposed study addresses pragmatic questions in a real-world health system that is highly motivated to improve access to care, self-efficacy, and outcomes for a diverse population of patients with diabetes. Our findings will inform future efforts to create benefit designs that are provider-endorsed, align with patient needs, address barriers to patient engagement, and improve patient capacity to maintain effective diabetes control.

Abstract:	Effectiveness of advanced practice pharmacy services among American Indian and Alaska Native adults with diabetes The Indian Health Service (IHS) funds services for approximately 2.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). IHS health care resources are strained due to limited per capita spending, the disproportionate high costs of treating AI/ANs with diabetes, and provider shortages. All-cause mortality of AI/ANs is 46% higher than that of non-Hispanic whites, attributable in part to higher mortality associated with diabetes. Within IHS, the provision of advanced practice pharmacy (APP) services for adults with diabetes has increased. During fiscal year (FY) 2008, approximately 1% of AI/ANs with diabetes used APP. Just 5 years later, 9.6% (n=4,620) had at least 1 APP visit in FY2013. To date, IHS has not had the institutional capacity to fully characterize the provision of APP services, nor study its effectiveness or costs. Given the need to both improve outcomes for patients with diabetes and effectively utilize limited IHS resources, this study's goal is to describe and assess the effectiveness of emerging models of APP within IHS for treatment of diabetes. Since 2010, IHS and Tribes have collaborated with the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health at the University of Colorado to create a longitudinal data infrastructure with health status, service utilization, and treatment cost data for over 640,000 AI/ANs, who represent nearly 30% of AI/ANs who use IHS services. The infrastructure, created through the Improving Health Care Delivery Data Project, is a synthesis of existing electronic data from multiple IHS platforms and currently includes data for 7 years (FY2007-2013) for 15 project sites. We propose to continue this collaboration by updating the infrastructure with recent data (FY2014-2017) to evaluate APP effectiveness among AI/AN adults with diabetes using statistical techniques made possible by the longitudinal data. The study has 3 aims: (1) characterize APP delivery models for adults with diabetes within sites and over time using site characteristics and patient health risk profiles (e.g., glycemic level [A1c], blood pressure [BP], cholesterol [CHL], cardiovascular disease). We anticipate that up to 3 models may emerge (e.g., targeted, limited, and general); (2) for each APP model, evaluate the nature and extent of the relationship between patient APP use and outcomes. Within each model, we expect that APP will improve medication adherence and A1c, BP, and CHL levels, and reduce onset of complications and preventable hospital stays; and (3) estimate APP delivery costs, treatment cost changes associated with lower use of other health services, and cost-effectiveness. We expect the APP models to be cost-effective.

Abstract:	The impact of disease beliefs on self-management of chronic illness such as diabetes (DM) in the setting of cancer is largely unknown. In addition, little is known about the impact of age- or cancer-related cognitive changes on cancer survivors' self-management behaviors (SMB) for their other comorbidities. Without this knowledge, our ability to provide optimal self-management support for cancer survivors with comorbidities is limited. The goal of this study is to determine how disease beliefs about cancer and DM and cognitive changes affect older breast cancer survivors' DM SMB. We will focus on older breast cancer survivors with early stage cancer who have received chemotherapy or hormonal therapy (HT) since these patients are more likely to have age- or cancer-related cognitive changes and are more likely to die from complications from their comorbidities as from their breast cancer. We will focus on DM due to its high prevalence in cancer survivors, association with worse cancer outcomes and cognitive decline, impact on competing risks of death, and its moderate SMB complexity. The study design is rooted in the common sense self-regulation model (CSM), a theory of health behaviors that has been used to develop interventions, but has primarily been applied to research on behaviors around single diseases. By understanding the relationship between disease beliefs about breast cancer and DM and the interrelationship of disease beliefs and cognitive function on survivors' DM SMB, we will advance both the CSM and care of older breast cancer survivors with comorbidities. The specific aims are to 1) evaluate the longitudinal interrelationship of beliefs about breast cancer and DM and its effect on survivors' DM SMB (adherence to medications, diet, and exercise); 2) assess the effect of cognitive function on DM SMB and evaluate whether disease beliefs mediate, in part, an association between cognition and DM SMB; and 3) develop and pilot an educational and counseling intervention to improve DM SMB among breast cancer survivors with comorbid DM. This prospective cohort study will recruit 320 older (>=55years) breast cancer survivors with pre-existing DM who have completed first-line chemotherapy or are taking hormonal therapy for treatment of early stage (I-IIIA) breast cancer within the past 5 years. We will first conduct qualitative interviews with 20 survivors to identify DM and cancer health beliefs and to elicit specific strategies and routines used to manage DM. We will then recruit 300 participants and interview them every 6 months for 24 months to assess longitudinal changes in cancer and DM beliefs and in cognition to evaluate their impact on DM SMB. For the subgroup of women currently taking HT, we will also assess the impact of beliefs and cognitive function on HT adherence. We will integrate the information collected in the quantitative and qualitative interviews to create educational and counseling modules and pilot test their impact on SMB on a group of 100 breast cancer survivors with DM. The proposed study addresses the need to develop strategies to optimize SMB for chronic comorbidities in cancer survivors using breast cancer and DM as the paradigm.

Abstract:	West Virginians have one of the highest prevalence of comorbid diabetes and hypertension in the United States, which poses an enormous disease and economic burden in this medically underserved state. Self-management of these conditions is an essential component of comprehensive disease management. The majority of self-management programs in West Virginia are clinic- or hospital-based, disease-specific, short-term, and provide limited participant interactions. The proposed study aims to fill this need by implementing a new and creative community-based, culturally appropriate, and cost-effective diabetes and hypertension self-management program (DHSMP) among adults with comorbid diabetes and hypertension. The DHSMP is adapted from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and AADE-7 self-care behaviors, and tailored for rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, using the community-based participatory approach. The DHSMP will be administered by trained health coaches and will involve communication between them and the participants to provide continuous feedback and reinforcement of self-management strategies and health education messages. We will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the 12-week DHSMP to an enhanced usual care (EUC) control group and conduct rigorous cost-effectiveness analyses. The DHSMP builds on the PI's successful prior community-based lifestyle intervention studies in rural Appalachia and rural India. Seventy adults with comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension will be recruited and randomized to 12-week DHSMP intervention (n=35) or an EUC control group (n=35) in two geographically separated Appalachian communities in WV. EUC participants will be waitlisted to receive DHSMP after 3 months. Specific aims will test the hypotheses that the participants randomized to receive the 12-week DHSMP will have significantly greater improvements in self-efficacy, and reductions in HbA1c and blood pressure as well as reduction in weight, and improvements in diet, physical activity, health-related quality of life, and social support at 3 and 6 months as compared to the EUC control group. We anticipate that the DHSMP will be cost-effective. Data on demographic, lifestyle factors, costs, anthropometric measures, and clinical indicators will be collected during baseline and post intervention periods (3 and 6 months). The results will inform the development and translation of large-scale community interventions to promote self-management of co-morbid chronic conditions in this medically underserved and rural Appalachian population.

Abstract:	One of the primary risk factors for peripheral artery disease (PAD) is type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM); 20-30% of adults with DM have PAD. The combination of PAD and DM (PAD+DM) puts individuals at a greater risk of poor health outcomes, compared to either condition alone. This is particularly true in regard to cardiovascular conditions. In fact, the risk of mortality is two times higher in adults with PAD+DM than in those with PAD alone. While exercise has been shown to be an effective therapy for improving walking distance among adults with PAD, there are some individuals, particularly those with PAD+DM, who experience a blunted response to exercise therapy. It is not known whether an increase in sedentary time occurs with structured exercise therapy for PAD, and could, in part, explain why some individuals with PAD+DM do not experience the same benefits from structured exercise therapy as individuals without DM. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if older adults with PAD, with and without DM, engaging in structured exercise therapy change their sedentary behavior and to determine the relationship between sedentary time, physical function, and quality of life, independent of physical activity. This study will use a prospective, pre-test post-test design and will include 50 older adults with PAD (25 with PAD+DM, 25 with PAD only) who are participating in a 12-week structured exercise therapy program. The aims of this study are to 1) evaluate the effect of structured exercise therapy on objectively measured, free-living sedentary time in older adults with PAD, with and without DM; and 2) determine if changes in sedentary time in the first 6 weeks of structured exercise therapy are associated with changes observed from baseline to 12 weeks in peak walking distance, physical function, falls, and quality of life in patients with PAD, with and without DM. At the completion of this study, we expect to have determined the variability, magnitude, and direction of change in sedentary time in older adults with PAD participating in structured exercise therapy and determined if the magnitude of change in sedentary time differs among older adults with PAD, with and without DM. We also expect to have determined if decreases in sedentary time are associated with improvements in peak walking distance, physical function, and quality of life and a reduction in falls, and if this relationship is independent of potential confounding variables (e.g., smoking, comorbidities, disease severity). The long-term goal of this research is to develop an intervention that can improve responsiveness to exercise interventions, reduce falls, and improve quality of life for older adults with PAD+DM. This study is significant because it could have a positive impact by helping older adults achieve optimal benefit from this method of self-management and reduce complications such as reduced physical function and decreased quality of life that are common in PAD. This improvement in quality of life and physical function could reduce morbidity and mortality, decrease health care costs, and help a growing population of older adults in the US with PAD enjoy greater health and wellbeing.

Abstract:	This application for a mentored clinical scientist research career development award (K08) is submitted by Elisabetta Patorno, MD, DrPH, in response to PA-16-191. Dr. Patorno is a preventive medicine physician and pharmacoepidemiologist in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. With a rapidly increasing US population >= 65 years, who use the largest proportion of medications, a better understanding of the effects of medications in older adults as used in routine care is imperative. This need is even more acute for new drugs that usually enter the market on the basis of evidence from relatively small, short, and often placebo-controlled randomized trials (RCTs), in which older patients are often underrepresented or excluded. As a result, clinicians often struggle choosing the best treatment for their older patients, particularly those with frailty and multimorbidity. Dr. Patorno is committed to a career as an independent clinical investigator, focused on advancing research for rigorously monitoring the effects of medications in older adults as treated in routine care. To achieve this, Dr. Patorno proposes a 4-year program of career development and mentored research centered on the development of a valid system for timely and high-quality evidence on new diabetes drugs in older patients specifically tailored to address the unique aspects of care in older patients, such as frailty and multimorbidity. This setting of research combines the urgent need for information on the effects of over 10 new antidiabetic agents approved by the FDA in the last decade with the need for the development of novel methods for prospective drug monitoring in real-world older adults. Within the highly productive and supportive research environment of the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology, Dr. Patorno will work with an interdisciplinary team of mentors and collaborators drawn from across institutions at Harvard University that have deep expertise and national/international reputations in the specific substantive areas of her proposed training: clinical geriatrics and diabetology, methods for prospective monitoring and data mining, and health services research in older populations. The overarching objective of her mentored research is to create and implement a novel approach for the near-real-time monitoring of the comparative safety and effectiveness of new diabetes drugs in older patients as treated in routine care. This novel monitoring approach will use Medicare claims data available with a relatively short lag time, linked to electronic medical records and the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. The proposed work will provide timely and actionable knowledge for clinicians treating older adults, defining the net incremental value of new antidiabetic agents in older patients with frailty and multimorbidity. The knowledge gained from this work will impact several million older adults in the US and will provide the applicant with a solid background to become an independent researcher, and ultimately a leader, in the study of medication use and outcomes in aging populations.

Abstract:	Many chronic health problems, like high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol, share risk factors. Currently, there are no tools that take into account each person's combinations of factors and provide personalized recommendations about which factors have the biggest impact on health and should be acted on first. The objectives of my research are to develop a computer program that uses statistics to predict the risk of diabetes complications for different combinations of factors, and make recommendations to doctors about actions that will have the most beneficial impact on preventing complications; and to ask doctors, nurses, and patients about how this program changed their treatment behaviour. This project makes an important step in turning evidence about how best to manage chronic diseases into action. The program I will develop may be adapted to different diseases and to use additional health databases in its calculations.

Abstract:	Background: During the transition to adult diabetes care, youth are at risk for admission to the hospital for life-threatening diabetes complications and for long gaps before establishing adult diabetes care. We don't know the best way to help youth with chronic diseases, including diabetes, to transition to adult care. The effect of a system-level transition intervention is not known. Improving transition is a key priority of the Ontario Pediatric Diabetes Network and other diabetes organizations. Objective: Our objective is to optimize care for youth with diabetes and to prevent acute diabetes complications during transition to adult care. Our specific aims are 1) to determine the baseline rate of and risk factors for diabetes-related admissions in early adulthood and 2) to determine the effectiveness of a system-level intervention to prevent diabetes-related admissions in early adulthood. Methods: We will follow all youth with type 1 diabetes from their final pediatric diabetes visit at five pediatric diabetes centres in Ontario and measure the rate of diabetes-related hospital admissions every 12 months before and after an intervention on April 1, 2018. The intervention has three parts: 1) a data platform to collect medical record data and link it to provincial data about physician visits and hospital admissions; 2) performance reports to participating pediatric centres about the rate of diabetes-related admissions in recently transitioned youth; these reports will inform centre-level quality improvement transition strategies; and 3) an online transition resource center for providers and families. Impact: Our project targets youth at high risk for diabetes-related problems during transition. If our intervention is effective, it can be used immediately by diabetes teams in Ontario and beyond. Our data platform can be expanded in scale to other jurisdictions to evaluate the impact of other quality improvement strategies.

Abstract:	Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most frequent pregnancy complications (up to 20% of pregnancies) and increases the risk for non-communicable diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes in the mother and/or her child, as well as the risk for postpartum depression. GDM is also involved in the fetal programming of long-term metabolic health. GDM risk factors that are potentially modifiable during pregnancy include excessive pregnancy weight gain, high fat consumption, physical inactivity, psychosocial stress, depression, and lack of social support. Lifestyle interventions for the treatment of GDM are often limited to nutrition or physical activity. They usually treat the mother or the child separately, take place either only during or after pregnancy, and their results are inconsistent. The multifactorial origins of GDM and the tight link between metabolic and mental as well as maternal and child health call for an interdisciplinary intervention. Due to the complex nature and the transgenerational transmission of these non-communicable diseases, we aim to scale up from the few existing interventions to a concerted complex, multidimensional interdisciplinary intervention: Aim: Our aim is to test the effects of a complex, interdisciplinary lifestyle and psychosocial continuous pre- and postpartum intervention to improve metabolic and mental health outcomes in women with GDM and their children up to 1 year postpartum. Primary aim: We expect that the 1) the decrease in maternal weight between study enrolment after GDM diagnosis and maternal weight at 1 year postpartum will be larger in the intervention group than in the control group and 2) that the decrease in maternal symptoms of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression score (EPDS) during the same time period will be larger in the intervention group than in the control group. Secondary aims: We expect that the intervention will improve other indicators of maternal and offspring metabolic and mental health at enrollment, and the peri- and postpartum period. We will also investigate longitudinal associations, thus increasing the understanding of the trajectories of maternal and child obesity, glucose intolerance, and mental health problems. Maternal secondary outcomes are (1) fat mass, gestational weight gain and weight retention, lifestyle behaviors, aerobic fitness and strength, metabolic and epigenetic laboratory biomarkers; and (2) other mental health indicators. Offspring secondary outcomes are (1) body composition, metabolic and epigenetic laboratory biomarkers; and (2) mental health indicators, such as self-regulation. Method: Our methods is a monocentric superiority open randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 200 women with GDM and their offspring randomly assigned (1:1) to either the intervention or the control group (treatment as usual). Patients will be recruited at 24-32 weeks of gestation after GDM diagnosis. The intervention will take place during pregnancy and the first year postpartum. On top of usual care offered in the control group, the intervention consists of 7 individual interdisciplinary sessions with dieticians, physiotherapists, clinical psychologists, and two group sessions. The team will provide counseling regarding weight gain recommendations and focus on specific dietary aspects (reduction of total lipid intake, prioritization of higher quality fats, and reduction of red or processed meats; mindful eating techniques; and regular structured eating). It will also provide encouragement for aerobic and resistance physical activity, screening for and treatment of depression using a stepped-care approach and facilitated self-help, and social support offers, including support from services, peers, and partners. Treatment goals for the infant focus on diet (continuation of breastfeeding for at least 6 months, recognition of hunger and satiety cues, and use of different soothing strategies), physical activity, and mental health (self-regulation capacity). Patients will be supported by a lifestyle coach. Assessors measuring the primary outcomes and other outcomes, such as biomarkers and questionnaires, and the statistician will be blind to group allocation. For the assessment of outcomes, validated online questionnaires and standardized devices, such as calibrated scales, accelerometer, bioimpedance, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and standardized motor tests will be used. Importance and impact: This RCT allows evaluating if a complex, interdisciplinary continuous pre- and postpartum lifestyle and psychosocial intervention leads to an improvement in both maternal and child metabolic and mental health outcomes. This study would also provide relevant findings regarding the understanding of GDM and potential pathways regarding the link between lifestyle, epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms, and mental health. This could result in significant changes in clinical practice and guidelines.

Abstract:	Currently, 86 million Americans have prediabetes, but 9 in 10 of them remain unaware. Randomized trials have demonstrated that more than half of all new cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed when high-risk adults are offered resource-intensive lifestyle intervention programs, such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). While numerous organizations have engaged in efforts to expand screening and subsequent access to interventions for adults with prediabetes, those services are far from routine in clinical and public health practice. However, implementation efforts in this arena are expected to accelerate rapidly during the next 3 years as several forthcoming policies will catalyze efforts to identify and intervene upon prediabetes. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently issued a grade B recommendation that all overweight or obese adults with cardiovascular risk conditions (including prediabetes) be offered intensive lifestyle interventions, specifically referencing the DPP as a case example. This recommendation, together with Affordable Care Act (ACA) legislation requiring commercial and public payers to provide coverage of USPSTF A and B recommendations, has led payers to begin structuring coverage policies that will include a mix of clinical and community intervention services. In parallel, key stakeholders such as YMCA of the USA and the American Medical Association (AMA) have engineered a series of strategic regional initiatives to strengthen health care-community linkages for the screening and diagnosis of prediabetes, as well as the coordination of referrals to community-based interventions, and the billing and payment for delivery of those interventions. In close collaboration with these stakeholders, we propose this natural experiment, employing a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methods, and leveraging available data from the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI), OptumHealth Care Solutions, and other accessible sources to evaluate the reach, implementation, effectiveness, and costs of these interrelated policies likely to impact the prevention of type 2 diabetes for potentially several million Americans over the next 5 to 10 years. Our proposal aims to (1) evaluate and compare the impacts of large-scale, regional health care-community linkages on changing rates of prediabetes screening, diagnosis, and National DPP intervention attendance following enactment of USPSTF recommendations for those services; (2) describe implementation features and elicit barriers and facilitators of implementation, replication, and future scaling of large-scale regional initiatives; and (3) compare the effects of exposure to the YMCA's DPP on health care costs and utilization for different subgroups of patients with prediabetes. This evaluation will provide critical information about whether particular strategies should be discontinued, refined, or replicated on a larger scale to achieve maximal impact over the coming decade.

Abstract:	The goal of this study is to compare how well motivational messages (text messages from the doctor's office), diabetes wellness coaches, and usual care with diabetes education materials provided at the doctor's office work to help African American adults with uncontrolled diabetes improve diabetes self-care decisions. Self-care is difficult when one has diabetes. But it becomes especially difficult when the diabetes is uncontrolled, the person has other medical conditions, and lives in an area without many primary care doctors. Many studies have shown that encouraging text messages from the doctor's office and health coaches can help people take better care of themselves. But before primary care clinics around the country start sending texts, hiring health coaches, or providing additional educational materials, it is critical for them to know which one is more likely to help. This study will assign African American diabetics to either motivational messages, diabetes wellness coaches, or usual care with diabetes educational materials. We especially want to find out if one works better for people at highest risk, like people who can't read medical information well, people who are very ill, people with depression, people who don't have smartphones, or older adults. We also want to know if one works better for people who live in the city versus people who live in the country. Lastly, we want to find out if messages or coaches help people improve their blood sugar, quality of life, and their feelings about primary care. The study will test motivational messages, diabetes wellness coaches, and usual care with diabetes educational materials side by side in primary care doctors' offices. The messaging and coaching programs will give patients the same information, but in different ways. The motivational messages will come from the doctor's office as text messages to the patient's mobile phone. The messages will be written carefully based on each patient's needs and interests, to give people support with reaching their goals for healthy eating, physical activity, and medication taking. The diabetes wellness coaches will be trained in how to help people get motivated. They will meet with people about once a month to give people support with reaching their goals for healthy eating, physical activity, and medication taking. This study will include 1,000 African American adults, ages 35 to 75, with uncontrolled diabetes and one or more additional chronic condition, living in medically underserved communities in the mid-South. People will have to have a cell phone or smart phone with texting capability to participate. Forty percent of participants will get messages, 40 percent will get coaches for one year, and 20 percent will receive usual care with diabetes educational materials. We will be able to tell whether messages and coaches work by seeing if people improve their diabetes self-care decisions, and if their blood sugar, quality of life, and feelings about primary care get better. Our long-term goal is to get primary care clinics nationally to start using motivational messages or diabetes wellness coaches if they work well.

Abstract:	Type 2 diabetes is common in the United States; about 1 in 10 people have the disease. Diabetes can cause devastating health events, such as hospitalizations, kidney failure, blindness, amputation, heart attack, stroke, painful nerve damage (neuropathy), and death. There are many barriers for patients with diabetes that get in the way of controlling risk factors, following recommendations, and getting the care they need from the health system to help prevent these complications; this is especially true for those with other health problems too. Those living in poverty and racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to have complications from diabetes, and less likely to get recommended care from health systems. In order to improve care and outcomes for people with complex medical problems, several states have started the Medicaid Health Home (HH) program, including New York State (NYS) in 2012. This program is for people with two or more chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, people with HIV, and people with a serious mental health condition. HHs are meant to manage and coordinate care, by helping health care providers, social service agencies, community-based organizations, and health insurance plans work together. Similar programs have been shown, on a smaller scale, to improve some results for patients with diabetes, such as lab tests indicating level of diabetes control. Studies have not yet looked at how a large program like HHs impacts the way health care is delivered and impacts the health events that matter most to patients with diabetes. Also, few studies include stakeholders on the research team, even though they stand to benefit the most from such programs, and have the experience needed as patients, clinicians, advocates, and administrators to guide efforts. We have gathered a research team that includes scientific investigators along with a diverse group of partners, including patients, clinicians, and program administrators. We plan to use two data sources that show what happens to individual patients over time: 1) NYS Medicaid insurance data and 2) the New York City-Clinical Data Research Network (NYC-CDRN). The NYC-CDRN has identified a group of patients with diabetes from seven large health systems; it has also developed a system for putting together the same set of information for each patient, and removing any identifying information. We will look at patients who have diabetes and are part of an HH and study what happened to them over time. We will also look at a comparison group of patients who are very similar to the HH patients, but did not join an HH, and follow them over time. We will then compare these two groups to each other. We will look at the quality of health care they received and their health outcomes. We will focus on health outcomes that are meaningful to patients. This study can provide important knowledge about the effects of the HH program on patients with diabetes.

Abstract:	Due to the prevalence of comorbidities among medically complex patients with type 2 diabetes, care coordination in diabetes management remains a major public health concern in the United States, especially in Louisiana where mortality and morbidity from poor glycemic control, diabetes complications, and cardiovascular disease are higher than in other regions of the United States. Non-face-to-face care coordination for chronic care management (CCM) had not been reimbursed by CMS until a recently implemented CPT code (99490) enabled primary care providers to receive payments (approximately $40.39 per month per qualifying patient) for this type of CCM under the 2015 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. These chronic care management services specifically include non-face-to-face care planning and management for patients with two or more chronic conditions. However, progress toward better chronic care management has been hindered by the lack of rigorous experiments in testing health policy interventions to inform efforts by health systems, communities, and stakeholders (patients, caregivers, providers). In addition, there is a lack of impact evaluations on patient-reported outcomes. To address these critical knowledge gaps, we propose using a natural experiment design to examine the impacts of the new CPT code for chronic care management on patient-centered outcomes. We will collaborate with partners in the Louisiana Clinical Data Research Network (LaCDRN) who serve more than 90,000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Louisiana. The first aim is to evaluate the barriers to and facilitators for implementing CMS chronic care management services overall and within each of the health systems. The analyses will identify critical elements of the programs that will enhance the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of these strategies in the diverse LaCDRN diabetes populations. The second aim is to examine the impacts of the CMS reimbursement for non-face-to-face care coordination to improve health outcomes (e.g., glycemic control, CVD risk reductions, lifestyle modification, and patient-reported outcomes) and health care utilizations between the created comparison groups based on age eligibility (Medicare vs. non-Medicare) as a natural experiment. The study questions and study outcomes will be patient-centered, with the engagement of patients and stakeholders, including health systems and payers. This proposal has received input from the LaCDRN Diabetes Advisory Groups (DAGs), health system leadership, and payer representatives. Two DAG members will serve as research partners on the project's steering committee and advisory panel. Broader patient and stakeholder engagement will also be planned and implemented on a regular basis across all phases of this natural experiment. The potential for further implementation and scale-up of the policy to other populations and settings would bring value to multiple health systems and non-Medicare populations.

Abstract:	More than half of the US adult population now has diabetes or prediabetes, a number that has continued to increase over recent years. Diabetes is associated with serious complications, including cardiovascular disease, blindness, end-stage renal disease, and lower-extremity amputation. Significant health disparities exist in diabetes, with racial and ethnic minorities having higher prevalence, and higher rates of complications and mortality, than their white counterparts. Recent health policy changes through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) may improve health care access, but whether they improve health outcomes needs to be evaluated in large samples of patients. The proposed work leverages the novel infrastructure of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute-funded PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN). The PaTH CDRN consists of four Mid-Atlantic academic health systems (Penn State Hershey Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Temple Health System, and Johns Hopkins Health System) that have established governance to operate as an integrated research network. In 2015, the University of Utah joined PaTH, creating an electronic health record (EHR)-based data infrastructure across three states (Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Utah) that have implemented the health policies under study differently. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the impact of two recently enacted health policies that affect diabetes care on the Healthy People 2020 diabetes objectives: (1) health insurance expansion through the ACA and (2) obesity counseling coverage by private and public health plans through the ACA and CMS. We propose comparing diabetes outcomes in three states--one that adopted Medicaid expansion immediately (Maryland), one that delayed Medicaid expansion until January 2015 (Pennsylvania), and one that has not adopted Medicaid expansion (Utah). Impact of these policy changes will be measured using EHR and claims data across the PaTH CDRN before and after these policies were implemented. The specific aims of this proposal are to evaluate the impact of the ACA, as implemented by state, on the Healthy People 2020 objectives for diabetes (primary outcome: hemoglobin A1c<7) in a cohort of patients across the CDRN. Further, we will evaluate the impact of preventive service coverage by both the ACA and Medicare on obesity screening and counseling, in patients with diabetes or at high risk for diabetes (i.e., pre-diabetes). Finally, the proposed project will evaluate the effect of the ACA implementation and CMS coverage of obesity counseling on diabetes service use, both over time and by state, as a function of the degree to which states have implemented the ACA and adopted CMS coverage.

Abstract:	Background: Shared medical appointments (SMAs)--group sessions of veterans with the same medical condition led by a multidisciplinary/multi-expertise team of providers--are now being widely implemented at VA facilities nationwide. Efficacy trials have found that SMAs in VA increase access to care and improve participants' self-management, clinical, and veteran-centered outcomes during and immediately after completion of the SMAs. Less is known about the effectiveness of SMAs as implemented on a large scale in different VA health systems, nor about the extent to which gains achieved through SMAs are maintained over time and, if not, what additional scalable approaches can best maintain improvements in self-management and clinical outcomes. Moreover, factors influencing effective implementation of SMAs and follow-up maintenance programs in diverse settings are poorly understood. One potentially scalable approach is telephone-based peer support in which fellow veterans provide support to each other. Because peers share similar characteristics, this approach is intrinsically culturally sensitive. Moreover, because most contacts are over the telephone, it is accessible to vulnerable patients who face obstacles to accessing clinic-based care. Objectives: This project will evaluate the implementation of diabetes SMAs in five VA health systems with some cohorts also being offered a novel program found in a recent VA randomized, controlled trial to significantly improve VA patients' diabetes-specific social support, insulin starts, and glycemic control compared to usual nurse care management. The program uses periodic group sessions in conjunction with calls between paired patients with diabetes to promote more effective care management as well as peer-to-peer (P2P) communication among diabetes patients who both have poor glycemic control and are working on similar care goals. Participants are matched with another patient of similar age and facing similar self-management challenges. "Peer buddies" are encouraged to talk by phone at least weekly to provide mutual support and share their progress on meeting their self-management goals. The goal of this service is to enhance the effect of shared medical appointments (SMAs), a service model demonstrated to be effective in improving outcomes among patients with diabetes and other chronic conditions and now being widely implemented in VA. Based on the success of the efficacy trial of this intervention, we now seek to evaluate a wider scale implementation of this program. Methods: Based on the success of separate efficacy trials of diabetes SMAs and of the P2P program, this project will examine the comparative effectiveness of SMAs alone, SMAs + P2P, and usual care without either of these programs and study the implementation process at five diverse VA facilities. Outcomes measured at 6 and 12 months post-enrollment include 1) changes in participants' glycemic and blood pressure control and statin use; 2) service utilization; 3) satisfaction with VA care; 4) diabetes-specific distress; 5) diabetes social support; and 6) diabetes self-management behaviors. Constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation (CFIR) have already been used in a completed pre-implementation formative evaluation at the study sites that was used to refine the implementation plan at each site. CFIR constructs will also be used during the post-implementation evaluation process to identify recommendations for facilitating widespread dissemination efforts and to contribute to the implementation science literature. Data will be gathered throughout implementation on staff effort required in order to calculate costs of the program. Findings: N/A. Impact: This study will provide important information on comparative effectiveness and barriers faced when SMAs and P2P are implemented as part of existing clinical processes.

Abstract:	As many as 60% of women with a pregnancy affected by gestational diabetes (GDM) will develop adult diabetes (type 2 diabetes mellitus, or T2DM) in their next decade. Postpartum glucose testing and continued monitoring in primary care after delivery can identify women at risk, prevent or delay the onset of T2DM, and reduce the severity of complications associated with the disease. However, fewer than half of women with a GDM pregnancy get glucose tests, and very few transfer from obstetric care to primary care in the first six months after delivery. We will analyze data from a large insurance-based data system (OPTUMTM) in two steps. The first step is to identify barriers and facilitators to post-delivery glucose testing with the recommended 84 day period and transition to primary care for continued monitoring. In the second step, we will analyze the contribution of testing and transition to primary care to post-GDM health outcomes (repeat pregnancy with GDM, onset of T2DM, and increase in BMI [as a measure of increased risk for T2DM] within three years post-delivery). This "big data" approach will provide the largest sample to date, and the first longitudinal analysis that begins prior to pregnancy and follows the same woman through for three years post-delivery. This data set has already been used to describe health care costs attributable to the economic burden of undiagnosed pre-diabetes, diabetes, and gestational diabetes. Our proposed study will investigate both individual and systems factors that explain why the majority of women with GDM do not take advantage of post-delivery opportunities for prevention of T2DM.

Abstract:	We will test the effectiveness and fidelity of embedding the American College of Physicians (ACP) diabetes health literacy intervention among patient-centered medical homes throughout rural Arkansas. Proper diabetes self-care requires patients to have considerable knowledge, a range of skills, and to sustain multiple health behaviors. Self-management interventions are needed that have been designed for individuals with lower literacy skills, that can be readily implemented and sustained among rural clinics with limited resources that disproportionately care for patients with limited literacy. Researchers on our team developed an evidence-based, patient-centered, low-literacy ACP intervention promoting diabetes self-care that includes 1) a diabetes guide that uses plain language and descriptive photographs to teach core diabetes concepts and empower patients to initiate behavior change; 2) a brief counseling strategy to assist patients in developing short-term, explicit, and attainable goals for behavior change ("action plans"); 3) a training module for providers (physicians, nurses, medical assistants) that prepares them to assume educator/counselor roles with the Diabetes Guide as a teaching tool; and 4) electronic tracking and monitoring tools for primary care practices. While the intervention has previously been field tested and found to significantly improve patient knowledge, self-efficacy, and engagement in related health behaviors, it has not yet been comprehensively tested in practices, and its optimal implementation is not known. We now have a unique opportunity to learn from our prior evaluation, modify, and disseminate an ACP health literacy intervention among patients with type 2 diabetes cared for at rural clinics in Arkansas that are patient-centered medical homes (PCMH). These practices are embedding care coordination services that can be leveraged to improve chronic disease management. All are supervised by a new University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Center for Health Literacy. Our revised intervention will blend outsourced and clinic-based approaches and redeploy health coaches for counseling self-management mostly via phone, but also at the point-of-care. This is a feasible way to reach rural, vulnerable patients. We will conduct a patient-randomized, pragmatic clinical trial among 6 rural PCMHs in Arkansas, targeting individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. Our primary aims are to 1) test the effectiveness of the ACP diabetes health literacy intervention to improve a range of diabetes-related outcomes among rural patients; and 2) compared to usual care, evaluate whether the intervention reduces disparities by patient literacy level. Our secondary aims are to 3) investigate whether a threshold or gradient effect exists between the amount of follow-up counseling (number of action plans) and intervention effectiveness; 4) determine the fidelity of all intervention components, and explore any identified patient, provider (physician, nurse, health coach), and/or health system barriers to implementation; and 5) assess the costs associated with implementing the intervention from a health system perspective.

Abstract:	Despite advances in the scientific knowledge related to diabetes prevention and management, diabetes prevalence, complications, and costs continues to rise. A majority of the dollars that go towards diabetes care are spent on emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and the management of diabetes complications. Changing the trajectory of the diabetes epidemic in the United States may require a fundamentally new approach to chronic disease management and reimbursement that emphasizes disease prevention and management. Accountable care organizations (ACOs) could be such an approach. Under this model, an organization is charged with the care of a population, receives a capitated payment and may be eligible for either a share of any savings achieved and/or at risk for a portion of any spending over the set target. As such, ACOs have been proposed as a means to simultaneously improve population health and reduce health care costs. The Alabama Medicaid program is undergoing a major transformation from a traditional fee-for-service model to the establishment of ACOs (referred to in Alabama as RCOs or regional care organizations). The Alabama Care Plan, one of 6 probationary RCOs, will assume care for over 70,000 Medicaid recipients in Region B, 11% of whom have diabetes. In April 2015, VIVA Health, a local managed care organization and the lead entity in the Alabama Care Plan, began creating care coordination teams that will work with individuals' current health care providers to comprise a larger "health home." This phased transition provides a unique opportunity for us to assess the impact of policy change related to reimbursement and the delivery of health care as it relates to diabetes. With this proposal, investigators will conduct a rigorous evaluation of the impact of this transition on outcomes in three dimensions: health of a population, experience of care, and per capita cost. The specific aims are (1) to examine changes in diabetes-related population health measures, including glycemic control (HbA1c) and indicators of diabetes care (quarterly HbA1c, annual eye exam); (2) to examine patient experience of care using a telephone-administered survey and qualitative interviews with a subset of individuals with type 2 diabetes enrolled in the Health Home; and (3) to examine changes in health care utilization and overall cost-effectiveness of the newly implemented RCO and Health Home compared to diabetes care before RCO implementation. Using Medicaid data beginning in 2010 through 2019, investigators will conduct interrupted time series analyses of data from enrollees within Region B and difference-in-differences analyses to compare changes over time in Region B with changes over time in 3 southern, non-ACO states. The multidisciplinary team of investigators has expertise in diabetes research, use of CMS data, survey administration, and qualitative methods. Alabama has the highest rate of diabetes in the United States. As such, this study could have important local and national policy implications for new approaches to diabetes management.

Abstract:	Diabetes affects nearly 26 million people in the U.S. and over 62 million in India, placing these nations second and third in the world in terms of population burden of diabetes. Diabetes is reported as increasing in younger age groups both in India and the US, with long-term implications for burden of complications, health care costs, and risk of diabetes in future generations. In 2000, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) established the Registry of People with Diabetes with Young Age at Onset (YDR), including youth and young adults less than 25 years of age from eight sites across India. In the U.S., the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study is a multicenter epidemiologic study conducting population-based case ascertainment of youth with diabetes before age 20 years since 2001, currently in five locations across the U.S. However, the ability to compare the epidemiologic characteristics of diabetes in youth between India and the U.S. is at present lacking. Knowledge of whether prevalence, incidence, mortality, and clinical presentation, treatment, quality of care, and quality of life differ can lead to new insights into the potential causes and improved treatment. A sensitive surveillance system in both countries can also inform policy about whether changes in underlying risk factors such as obesity, environmental exposures, and other factors are leading to an increase in risk, or whether improved nutrition and environmental hygiene have reduced risk over time. These challenges have been identified by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and the ICMR, who sponsored an Indo-U.S. workshop titled "Innovative Approaches and Technologies for Diabetes Prevention and Management," held on February 4-6, 2013, in New Delhi. In response to the recent NIDDK funding opportunity announcement (FOA), we propose to conduct preliminary harmonization work of U.S. and Indian registries of childhood diabetes to address several specific aims: (aim 1) to harmonize the Indian YDR and the SEARCH registry in the U.S; (aim 2) to compare phenotypic, clinical, and demographic characteristics by type of diabetes between YDR and SEARCH; and (aim 3) to compare the burden of diabetes in youth by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and type of diabetes between India and the US. Harmonization of the SEARCH and YDR registries is a critical step towards building capacity to understand global trends. This application is significant in proposing to harmonize registries covering both T1D and T2D at a critical moment in history when trends in diabetes are dynamic yet poorly understood from a global perspective.

Abstract:	This R01 grant proposal is a response to PA-14-112 "A Family-Centered Self-Management of Chronic Conditions." The project (a) evaluates four culturally adapted, family-based treatments designed to improve health status, self-management behaviors and self-efficacy among Mexican Americans with type 2 diabetes using a sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial in a public health setting; and (b) tests hypotheses about the applicability of Ryan and Sawin's individual and family self-management theory, the conceptual foundation for the intervention's key constructs, to the study of diabetes self-management in this population. This conceptual model was selected for study because its emphasis on the integration of family members as partners in care while promoting illness self-management is highly germane to the study population and to the proposed intervention. Spanish speaking, Mexican American patients with type 2 diabetes and their families will be recruited from a primary care clinic affiliated with a large, urban public hospital located in a predominantly Mexican American area of Los Angeles. In the first phase of the study, subjects will be randomly assigned to six 2.5 hour sessions (three months) of either 1) Tomando Control de su Diabetes (TC), a culturally tailored, community-based, diabetes self-management program delivered in a group format by community health workers (promotoras) working with individual patients and families; or 2) TC delivered by health professionals (licensed nurses). Evaluations will be made at baseline, three months, six months and 12 months. After six weeks of treatment (at the midway point of the intervention), subjects will be assessed for improvement in diabetes self-management behaviors (the primary outcome). In the second phase of the study, those subjects who have improved their diabetes self-management behaviors by 50% over baseline will be continued in their assigned treatment for the duration of three months. Those subjects who do not meet this target will be re-randomized to receive either 1) an augmented version of TC that has a specific focus on engaging family members; or 2) a multifamily group treatment led by nurses specially trained in teaching diabetes self-management skills for an additional three months. Subjects will be assessed on setting and adhering to self-management goals related to diabetes; self-management behaviors including adhering to the ADA diet, engaging in exercise activities, monitoring glucose levels, and taking prescribed hypoglycemic medications; diabetes self-efficacy; and hemoglobin A1c levels. Family members will be assessed during these same time frames to determine their knowledge of diabetes care; levels of collaborative goal setting with their ill relative and the health care provider; and levels of family support. The results will advance the understanding of the factors that affect self-management for Mexican Americans with type 2 diabetes, and will provide valuable information towards constructing an adaptive intervention that will help to determine which treatment strategies work to improve diabetes self-management behaviors most efficiently and for whom.

Abstract:	Background and significance: Diabetes is a national health problem, yet Latinos from low-income households are at greater risk. Although guidelines recommend that patients learn self-management strategies, many are not able to do so effectively and cannot control their diabetes. Studies show that culturally competent self-management programming can help, but patients told us that not all programs sufficiently respect patients' cultural values or account for their socioeconomic limitations. Study aims: This project will compare two models for culturally competent diabetes self-management programming. Our hypothesis is that the program model that best considers patient culture and accommodates patient socioeconomic circumstances will have the best outcomes. Study design: We have designed the research to follow PCORI's scientific requirements. We have completed calculations to make sure that enough people will participate so that our findings will be scientifically meaningful. We will gather data about patients at each of the programs. We made a detailed project timeline with specific accomplishments that include both scientific and engagement activities. We assembled a research team with the expertise and experience in patient-engaged research necessary for the proposed study, and we have support from both our university and our community partners. We also have included many opportunities for paid patient participation. Things we compare: We will compare two diabetes self-management program models used by many Latino patients from low-income households in Albuquerque, New Mexico: 1) the Diabetes Self-Management Support Empowerment Model and 2) the Chronic Care Model. Study population: Our patient advisors told us that gathering data from individuals alone does not account for important social aspects of Latino patients' lives, so we will recruit patients and ask them to invite someone close to them to participate too. Patients will be individuals who consider themselves to be Latino and who are from low-income households. We will recruit 240 patient-caregiver pairs through the two sites. Primary outcome: The primary outcome to be measured is improved capacity for diabetes self-management, measured as diabetes knowledge and patient activation or the ability to put that knowledge into action. Secondary outcome: The secondary outcome to be measured is successful diabetes self-management measured through reduced A1c, body mass index (BMI), and depression. We will also consider two exploratory clinical measures: 1) patient body composition; and 2) patient stress levels, measured using hair samples, to identify levels of cortisol as a biological marker for chronic stress. Methods: We will use statistical calculations to make sure that the things we are comparing are differences in program design and not differences in individual patient characteristics. We will compare whether the programs improve diabetes health knowledge, ability to act, A1c, BMI, body composition, and depression and stress control, and we will determine which program is best.

Abstract:	Self-management is integral to control of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Effective self-management, however, requires real-time information on health status and behaviors and ongoing health professional facilitation of patients as they monitor and perform self-management. Accurate, timely information for these activities is notably absent from the current health care system. Providing real-time data would help patients and their care providers better understand illness dynamics, develop adaptive approaches to improve health outcomes, and deliver personalized care when and where it is most needed. Emerging mobile health technologies may facilitate adaptive self-management by patients with diabetes by capturing diabetes-related data and providing feedback to patients directly. Sharing these data in real time with the patient and health care provider can foster collaborative work and change care delivery from infrequent episodic care delivery to real-time care at the point in time when patients need it most. However, to date we have little knowledge of how to support patients to use data from mobile technologies for real-time care and do not know how long patients will track multiple types of diabetes-related data. Moreover, we do not know what strategies will best help patients overcome self-management challenges using self-generated diabetes-related data or how providers might most effectively guide patients to better self-manage in real-time. We propose a mixed-methods exploratory study of 50 patients from a primary care clinic with a diagnosis of T2DM; they will be asked to track relevant clinical data over 6 months using a wireless body scale, phone-tethered glucometer, a wrist-worn accelerometer (i.e., Fitbit), and a medication adherence text message survey. Data generated from the devices will be plotted as trajectories that will help us to understand the adaptive challenges that patients face in self-management. A subset of patients will be interviewed at monthly intervals over the 6 months to discuss their adaptive challenges and successes in diabetes self-management. Following the 6-month data collection period, we will conduct focus groups with providers to explore ways to address collaborative work to self-manage diabetes using self-monitoring data, and meet real-time challenges in diabetes self-management.

Abstract:	We will study the use of a new technology, retrospective continuous glucose monitoring (r-CGM), to help achieve glucose targets for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in general practice (GP). This is important because controlling glucose levels improves disease outcomes and because T2D is mostly managed in GP where the majority of people are out of glucose target levels and GPs and patients currently don't have a simple effective method for monitoring blood glucose levels to guide treatment.

Abstract:	Diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of blindness among working-age U.S. adults despite the fact that major NEI clinical trials show that early detection and treatment reduce the risk of severe vision loss by 90%. Adherence with yearly diabetic retinopathy screening guidelines in the U.S has stagnated at 50%. Ocular telemedicine (i.e., tele-ophthalmology) can be highly effective for increasing diabetic retinopathy screening rates, but there is very limited utilization of these programs in multi-payer health systems, which constitute the majority of U.S. health care systems. Significant barriers exist to the successful application of tele-ophthalmology, but these barriers are poorly understood. Dr. Liu's K23 research plan aims to (1) identify primary care provider- and patient-level barriers and facilitators to tele-ophthalmology screening for diabetic retinopathy in a rural, multi-payer health system; (2) develop an implementation package to overcome those barriers at a single primary care site; and (3) pilot-test the impact of this implementation package on diabetic retinopathy screening rates at multiple primary care clinics. She hypothesizes that this implementation package, structured upon well-established frameworks for increasing adherence with diabetes care guidelines and health care process improvement, will successfully integrate tele-ophthalmology into the existing health care system, and will both achieve and maintain increased diabetic retinopathy screening rates. Dr. Liu's long-term career goal is to reduce vision loss in underserved communities by expanding access to eye care through ocular telemedicine. Her proposed mentored research and training would provide the further skills needed to become an independent investigator in ophthalmic health services delivery with additional expertise in the emerging field of dissemination and implementation science. She will access a wealth of resources through the University of Wisconsin, including accomplished NIH-funded mentors and collaborators in the multidisciplinary fields of telemedicine, epidemiology, mixed methods (i.e., qualitative and quantitative), dissemination and implementation, industrial/systems engineering, and health services research. This K23 proposal directly responds to multiple elements of the National Eye Institute's (NEI) Health Disparities Strategic Plan and National Plan for Eye and Vision Research (NPEVR). These include areas of emphasis in health services research, diabetic retinopathy, and expanding access to rural, underserved populations. The NEI Health Disparities Strategic Plan states that telemedicine has great "potential to reduce access disparities" and the NPEVR calls to "expand efforts in telemedicine to manage diabetic retinopathy...for rural and/or underserved populations." By understanding how to effectively integrate and utilize ocular telemedicine in multi-payer health systems, Dr. Liu's research will facilitate the effective translation of telemedicine technology into improved diabetic retinopathy screening rates in the community. Building from this work, she plans to develop future telemedicine screening and management protocols for other major causes of visual disability such as uncorrected refractive error, macular degeneration, and glaucoma. Advancements in ocular telemedicine have the potential to provide unparalleled access to eye care for millions of Americans and the effective translation of these technologies will be critical both for addressing health disparities as well as to meet the growing needs of our aging population.

Abstract:	Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Laser photocoagulation surgery has been established as an effective way of treating retinopathy if it is detected early. Yearly retinal screening examinations are a potent tool in the battle to reduce the incidence of blindness from diabetic retinopathy because they provide diabetic patients with timely diagnoses and consequently, the potential for timely treatment. Primary care safety net clinics provide monitoring and other services for diabetic patients, but they are often not equipped to provide specialty care services such as retinal screenings. Access to specialists who can provide retinal screenings can be increased through the use of telemedicine, which has shown great promise as a means of screening for diabetic retinopathy in the US and internationally. A pilot study by Charles Drew University investigators had a total of 2,876 teleretinal screenings performed for diabetic retinopathy, with 2,732 unique diabetic patients from six South Los Angeles safety net clinics screened. The present study aims to build on this prior work by (a) developing novel software that utilizes information from clinical records to detect latent diabetic retinopathy in diabetic patients who have not yet received an annual eye examination, and (b) devising methods to speed up the diabetic retinopathy detection process for diabetic patients who have had digital retinal images taken by partially automating the process using image processing and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we propose to (1) develop predictive models for diabetic retinopathy using risk factors collected from patient clinical records; (2) develop predictive models for automated diabetic retinopathy assessment using a combination of patient risk factor data and data from digital retinal images previously evaluated by experts; (3) evaluate the predictive accuracy of a) the models developed for specific aim 2 and b) the assessments of optometrist readers against standard of care dilated retinal examinations by board-certified ophthalmologists for 300 diabetic patients utilizing a new Los Angeles County reading center; (4) create web-based software tools based on the predictive models developed in specific aim 1 that can be used to initiate outreach to high-risk patients in under-resourced settings, boosting detection rates for those patients who are most at risk for diabetic retinopathy; and (5) establish targeted outreach methods to promote screening for patients that the predictive models from specific aim 1 identify as potentially having undetected diabetic retinopathy.

Abstract:	This proposal outlines a 5-year training and research program that will allow the investigator to achieve his goal of becoming an independent academic patient-oriented researcher. The candidate will use his strong academic background, training, and expertise in maternal health and women's health to improve on care, screening, outcomes, and follow-up of women with history of gestational diabetes and hypertensive disease in pregnancy by focusing on metabolic syndrome, a direct predictor of cardiovascular disease. As a master's student, the candidate designed and conducted a successful clinical trial on male partner and couple HIV testing during pregnancy. He has also been a Fogarty scholar and Fellow, during which he served as a study coordinator in enrolling and following up with participants for two years. The proposed program will build on the candidate's extensive experience with clinical research in resource constrained settings by improving his skills in study design and epidemiologic analysis of longitudinal data and enhancing his understanding of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, and the role of inflammatory markers in the disease process. The candidate is supported by excellent expert mentors in an outstanding institutional environment and a highly successful collaborative partnership between the University of Nairobi and the University of Washington. Research plan: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in sub-Saharan Africa is a growing burden, and predominantly affects younger people and women. Hypertensive disease in pregnancy (HDP) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) increase the risk of future CVD more than two-fold. HDP, GDM, and CVD are characterized metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of factors that directly increase the risk of CVD, suggesting a shared pathology, which can be targeted for screening, monitoring, and intervention. In contrast to high-income countries that have guidelines on monitoring women after HDP and GDM, women in LMIC do not have access to these services or CVD prevention and instead present with established CVD. Compared to the rest of the world, CVD in sub-Saharan Africa is distinctively different in its inflammatory and not atherosclerotic etiology, and women in sub-Saharan Africa may therefore have unique differences that influence the association between HDP and GDM, MetS, and CVD. We propose to conduct a prospective cohort study to estimate the burden and characteristics of metabolic syndrome in Kenya, following HDP and GDM using the following specific aims: (aim 1) demonstrate that women with versus those without HDP and GDM are more likely to have MetS at 24 weeks post-delivery; (aim 2) among women without MetS at 24 weeks post-delivery, determine whether HDP and GDM is associated with increased diagnosis of MetS during 3 years of follow-up; and (aim 3) determine sociodemographic and biological correlates of women who are diagnosed with MetS compared to those without MetS at different time points from 24 to 36 months post-delivery that may lead to improved screening and follow-up of women with HDP and GDM. Our study findings will inform use of high attendance of maternal health clinics in sub-Saharan Africa, where at least 1 in 10 women are diagnosed with hypertensive disease of pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus, as a window of opportunity for post-delivery strategies to identify women with MetS for timely CVD prevention interventions. These findings may inform maternal health and primary care linkages, and development of screening and monitoring strategies of women with HDP, GDM, and MetS in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract:	A shortage of primary care physicians makes it difficult to deliver quality diabetes care to Americas aging population. A frequently recommended approach to compensate for escalating primary care physician shortages, while still meeting the chronic illness care needs of an aging population, is to incorporate physician assistants (PAs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) into primary care teams. While a number of team models incorporating PA&NPs have delivered quality care to patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, data is limited regarding which clinician team approaches are most effective. Identifying effective approaches to incorporating PA&NPs into primary care teams that care for older patients will require identification of effective PA&NP roles, as well as features of PA&NP and physician interaction (interdependence and coordination) that can improve patient outcomes. Interdependence between primary care PA&NPs and physicians occurs when they provide care to, or "share" common patients. Managing shared patients between clinicians requires coordination. Coordination can be accomplished through multiple methods, including routines (ex: clinical pathways), boundary spanners (ex: case managers), team meetings (ex: huddles), and relational coordination (i.e., communication and relationships) and is believed to be a key mechanism by which clinician teams will improve patient outcomes, particularly for older, complex patients with multiple chronic conditions. Focus has been placed on improving patient outcomes by coordinating care between settings, such as between specialists and primary care. To our knowledge, however, no studies have evaluated the impact of interdependence and/or coordination within primary care on patient diabetes outcomes such as glycemic and lipid control or development of patient treatment goals. My long-term goal is to improve chronic illness care for older complex patients through identification and implementation of effective primary care teams. In order to develop and evaluate team interventions, it is critical to address the medical and social aspects of team-based care delivery. Designing and evaluating interventions that address both aspects of team care require a range of knowledge and skills, including expertise in mixed-methods research approaches, organizational theory, and implementation science. The objective of this application is to determine if PA&NP and physician interaction (interdependence and coordination) on teams impacts outcomes for older patients with diabetes. My health policy background, clinical experience as a PA, and formal quantitative research training will provide the foundation for the proposed project. I will pursue career development in mixed methods, and implementation science and organizational theory at both Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). The specific aims of the proposed project are to describe the methods of coordination utilized between PA&NPs and physicians on primary care teams (aim 1); to evaluate the relationship between the interdependence of PA&NPs and physicians on primary care teams and outcomes (glycemic and lipid control as well as patient treatment goals) for older patients with diabetes (aim 2); and to determine if methods of coordination mediate the relationship between PA&NP role, interdependence, and outcomes for older patients with diabetes (aim 3). To achieve these aims, I propose a mixed-methods approach. I will collaborate with Duke Primary Care to conduct interviews and surveys with health care professionals from Duke's clinics regarding the full range of coordination mechanisms used within their teams and practices (aim 1). This information will be combined with data derived from electronic health records for medically complex patients over the age of 65 with diabetes in order to match PA&NP and physician interactions (aim 2) with patient outcomes (aim 3). Synthesis of aims 1-3 will inform development of a primary care team-based intervention involving clinician interdependence and coordination for an R01 proposal aimed at improving chronic disease management in complex older patients with diabetes. This proposal sets forth essential development steps that are analogous to preclinical/phase 1 studies that are pivotal to guide later successful intervention trials. Skills gained in organizational psychology, mixed methods, and implementation science will complement my prior clinical and research training to position me for success as an independent health services researcher with the skills to design and implement health care teams that improve chronic disease management for complex older patients.

Abstract:	The population of Cambodia is rapidly aging. Life expectancy at birth has increased from 58 years in 1995 to 71 years in 2012, driving the rate of previously unknown non-communicable diseases (NCDs) skyward. Ischemic heart disease and stroke are now the top two causes of mortality in this low-income country, and rates of cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension and diabetes are dramatically increasing. While the Cambodian government has done little to address the growing burden of NCDs afflicting its people, a non-governmental organization (NGO), MoPoTsyo Patient Information Center, has stepped in. Using a model of community-based patient-led Peer Educator Networks, MoPoTsyo is currently delivering self-management training and medications to over 21,000 hypertensive and diabetic patients in Cambodia. In spite of the considerable success this model has demonstrated, control of these conditions--particularly hypertension among non-diabetics--remains a challenge. The primary aim of this application, in response to PAR-14-028, Mobile Health: Technology and Outcomes in Low and Middle Income Countries (R21), is to enhance the communication network between the MoPoTsyo patient database, peer educators, pharmacies, and patients, using mobile eHealth tools to activate better compliance with treatment guidelines. Specifically, we plan to 1) finalize enhanced features of the mHealth communications application for self-management of hypertension and diabetes, and pilot test it with end-users for acceptability and ease of use; 2) implement a randomized controlled clinical intervention to assess the mHealth communications application in rural and urban-poverty communities for reducing study outcomes related to diabetes and hypertension; and 3) share results with the Cambodian Ministry of Health and development partners in order to inform health policy makers of study findings and to develop strategies for improving control of hypertension and diabetes throughout Cambodia. This e-health communication system using mobile phone technology will include (a) voice messaging in Khmer allowing illiterate users to participate, (b) interactive tailored reminders and messages to patients for improving support for treatment adherence and goal achievement, (c) integration of messages received and responses from users into the health care database to trigger new messages, (d) access to pharmacy data to monitor individual adherence to medication, (e) access of health care information to peer educators to improve monitoring of patients over time, and (f) use of the system to integrate data into the MoPoTsyo database for reports and surveillance of patients. Fifty peer educators representing over 6,000 rural, sub-urban, and urban patients will be randomized to the intervention or control. Process outcomes and health indicators, including control of blood pressure and glucose, medication adherence, and lifestyle factors such as smoking, body mass index, diet, and exercise, will be evaluated. Results will be used to help develop national health policies addressing the great need for NCD control in Cambodia and serve as a model of other countries in SE Asia.

Abstract:	Background: One million veterans (25%) who receive health care through Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes and are therefore responsible for daily diabetes self-management (DSM). DSM is essential for glycemic control and prevention of potentially life threatening and disabling complications such as severe hypoglycemia, kidney failure, acute coronary syndrome, and stroke. Importantly, 40% of individuals with diabetes suffer from diabetes-related distress (DRD) that interferes with their ability to sustain healthy self-management behaviors, and may be particularly problematic for veterans who are at higher risk for comorbid negative emotional states such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Diabetes self-management education (DSME) has traditionally contained little content or skill building directly related to stress management, leaving this critical component of diabetes self-management largely unaddressed in DSME. In our pilot work, we have developed a brief stress management intervention known as Mind-STRIDE, which contains mindfulness training and home practice and is easily integrated into existing DSME. While we have previously demonstrated the feasibility, patient acceptability, and initial efficacy of Mind-STRIDE, its effects on diabetes-related psychological and physiological patient outcomes remain unknown. There is, therefore, a critical need to determine the efficacy of this targeted mindfulness intervention for improving DRD, diabetes self-efficacy, DSM behaviors, and metabolic control of veterans with diabetes in order to offer comprehensive, evidence-based DSME that improves veteran-centric diabetes outcomes. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to determine the efficacy of Mind-STRIDE for improving DRD, diabetes self-efficacy, DSM, and metabolic control, and to characterize distinctive veteran experiences with DRD and Mind-STRIDE. Methods: To achieve these objectives, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 126 veterans at a large VA medical center in southwest PA. Participants will be assigned to one of two study conditions: an experimental group that receives routine diabetes education plus Mind-STRIDE, or to a usual care group that receives diabetes education alone. DRD, diabetes self-efficacy, and DSM will be assessed using self-report questionnaires. Metabolic control (hemoglobin A1c) will be assessed using standard laboratory procedures. Data will be collected at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks, and will be analyzed using mixed-effects models. Telephone interviews will be conducted at 15 weeks post-intervention in a subset of participants from the experimental group and will be analyzed using modified grounded theory methods. Quantitative and qualitative findings will be compared and interpreted using convergent parallel design. Findings: The sample of participants recruited thus far (n=62) is mostly older, white male veterans with a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The average PAID score (Problem Areas in Diabetes, a measure of DRD) for the sample thus far at baseline is 36.8/100, generally indicating high levels of DRD, and the average hemoglobin A1c value at baseline is 8.7%, indicating poor glycemic control. Data collection is ongoing, but preliminary feedback from the qualitative telephone interviews conducted with experimental group participants suggests that participants are satisfied with the Mind-STRIDE training program and have integrated it into both their diabetes care and other aspects of their lives where stress reduction is needed. Impact: By examining the acceptance and effects of Mind-STRIDE among veterans who have diabetes, the VA will benefit from new evidence-based, patient-centered approaches that support self-care and provide a bridge from the clinic to home. Data collection is ongoing. There are no further anticipated impacts to describe at this time.

Abstract:	This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Elizabeth Burner, an emergency physician and patient-oriented clinical researcher at the University of Southern California. She is developing a research agenda examining novel communication technologies to improve patient self-management of diabetes. This K23 award will provide Dr. Burner with support to (1) become an expert in mixed-methods research strategies, (2) conduct clinical investigations of a mobile phone-based behavioral intervention for urban Latino patients with diabetes that incorporates an augmented social module, (3) conduct sophisticated statistical analysis to examine patient characteristics that impact the intervention's efficacy, and (4) develop an independent clinical research career. Dr. Burner has established a mentoring team led by Dr. Thomas Buchanan with expertise in diabetes and interventions among low-income Latinos and two co-mentors: 1) Dr. Anne Peters, with expertise in clinical trials with patients with diabetes; and 2) Dr. Shinyi Wu, with expertise in health systems, mobile health interventions, and non-English speaking patients. She will also have key advisors in 1) Dr. Sanjay Arora, with expertise in mobile health with emergency department patients; 2) Dr. Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, with expertise in qualitative methods and culturally sensitive interventions for Latinos; and 3) Dr. Wendy Mack, with expertise design and statistical analysis of non-cancer clinical trials. Dr. Burner will be taking formal coursework, participating in several research seminars at the University of Southern California, and will conduct a mentored research project. Diabetes has disproportionately affected the Latino population. TExT-MED (Trial to Examine Text Message for Emergency Department Patients with Diabetes) is a locally designed, successful mobile health (mHealth) intervention for low-income Latinos with diabetes. Social support interventions have likewise been successful at improving patient self-efficacy and disease management but are limited in scale due to two key obstacles: 1) requirements of in-person training of family and friends to be supporters and 2) the need to coordinate schedules and physical location between the patient and their supporter. mHealth can overcome these obstacles by allowing supporters to be trained remotely via a mobile platform and by allowing communication between a patient and supporter to occur at any time or place. The proposed intervention leverages the success of TExT-MED by augmenting the program with a social supporter that each patient can select from his or her own social support system (Family And friend Network Supporters [FANS]), creating TExT-MED+FANS. Aim 1 refines and lengthens the preliminary TExT-MED+FANS intervention through focus groups and individual interviews with cognitive interview techniques. Aim 2 conducts a 12-month, randomized pilot study of this intervention. Preliminary data will be collected on change in glycemic control measured by hemoglobin A1c and change in healthy behavior choices measured by multiple validated scales to support a future fully powered trial. Lastly, aim 3 evaluates the user experience with TExT-MED+FANS, and the impact of TExT-MED+FANS on patient motivation, self-efficacy, and behaviors, through a qualitative analysis of semi-structured individual interviews. This research will form the basis for a fully powered study of this mHealth intervention to improve diabetes behaviors and outcomes for a bilingual population.

Abstract:	The Foundation's initiative, Innovations in Value from Low-Resource Communities, was designed to fund evaluations of innovative approaches to improving value in low-resource communities and populations. This grant supports an evaluation of the work of the Access Community Health Network (ACCESS), a federally qualified health center and a national leader in the delivery of community-based health care, with 25 years of experience in serving low-income African American and Hispanic communities in the Chicago metropolitan area. The scale and capacity of ACCESS, which serves 180,000 patients annually through 36 health centers, has allowed it to implement and evaluate transformative practices that address health disparities. As a patient-centered medical home certified by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, ACCESS has implemented a medical model of care that accounts for the social needs of patients. Within this framework, the evaluation question will focus on whether the integration of screening for food insecurity into a primary care setting improves diabetes control. The evaluation will identify the most cost-effective approach to implement the innovation in varying types of communities that face health disparities and will inform how to minimize patient barriers to accessing food. Deliverables will include publishing results in professional journals, presenting at local convenings and national conferences, and distributing a report on findings to interested stakeholders.

Abstract:	Many African Americans and Latinos with diabetes do not achieve recommended diabetes goals, placing them at high risk for complications. Team-based models of care can help in reaching goals of therapy. Additionally, mobile health (mHealth) technologies can further improve outcomes among those more difficult to reach. This study will evaluate the impact of a team-based, mHealth intervention designed to improve medication adherence, healthy eating, and physical activity behaviors. We will compare this mHealth approach with usual care. Clinical pharmacists and health coaches (HC) will deliver our proposed team-based intervention. MHealth delivery includes mobile phone text messaging, secure videoconferencing, and HC home visits. Pharmacists will focus on medication reconciliation and adherence. Health coaches will help identify psychosocial and environmental challenges to adherence in a culturally sensitive manner. Together, they can assist in goal setting, problem solving, and negotiation of competing priorities, and provide social support leveraging mHealth technologies. Preliminary data from our research group supports the role of health coaches partnering with clinic-based pharmacists in improving diabetes outcomes in minorities. In the proposed mHealth intervention, patient-pharmacist videoconferencing will eliminate the need for in-person visits with a pharmacist, which is impractical for many low-income patients. In addition, our pilot work suggests that text messaging is a preferable means of communication and may facilitate more frequent contact with patients. We propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an mHealth diabetes adherence support intervention delivered by clinical pharmacists and health coaches. We will randomize 220 patients through UI Health to either (1) mHealth diabetes adherence support through clinical pharmacists and health coaches or (2) usual care. After one year, patients completing the mHealth intervention will be monitored for an additional year while the usual care group receives the mHealth approach. Outcomes include medication adherence, hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol levels. The specific aims include (1) evaluate the effectiveness of an mHealth diabetes adherence support intervention delivered by clinical pharmacists and health coaches to African American and Latino adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes; (2) evaluate the maintenance of improved diabetes behaviors as well as clinical outcomes one year after completing the intervention; (3) evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of mHealth diabetes adherence support compared to usual care; and (4) evaluate the reach, adoption, and implementation of mHealth diabetes adherence support based on the RE-AIM framework.

Abstract:	Background: Nearly 26 million people in the US--or 8.3% of the population--has diabetes. Premature death and disability can be prevented for persons with diabetes through implementation of evidence-based programs and policies (EBPPs). Local health departments (LHDs) are uniquely positioned to implement diabetes control EBPPs because of their knowledge of, and focus on, community-level needs, contexts, and resources. There is a significant gap, however, between known diabetes control EBPPs and actual diabetes control activities conducted by LHDs. Goal: This proposal seeks to reduce the burden of diabetes by increasing adoption of EBPPs among LHD practitioners. Methods: This is a two-phase study that takes a comprehensive approach to elucidate effective tactics for dissemination and implementation (D&I) of EBPPs among LHD practitioners. Phase 1: We will refine and test measures to assess the adoption of EBPPs in LHDs, building on pilot work. Phase 2: We will conduct a qualitative needs assessment of 15 LHDs in Missouri to understand factors influencing the adoption of diabetes control EBPPs. We will then conduct a pre/post, experimental (group-randomized) study of 30 LHDs in Missouri to evaluate the effectiveness of active D&I approaches. The intervention arm of this study (15 LHDs) will receive a flexible "menu" of D&I approaches that account for local contextual and organizational factors. The control arm (15 LHDs) will receive a minimal "usual care" intervention. We will conduct multivariate regression analyses to model the factors important to improving adoption of diabetes control EBPPs, and will conduct social network analysis to understand the relationships and contextual issues that influence EBPP adoption. We will translate and disseminate findings from phases 1 and 2 to LHD practitioners and practice-related stakeholders in order to support the sustainable practice of diabetes control among LHDs. Innovations and impact: This study is innovative and impactful because it will 1) be the first to identify effective approaches for increasing the adoption of diabetes control EBPPs among LHDs in the US; 2) be the first to develop valid and reliable objective measures of EBPP adoption levels in LHDs; 3) augment diffusion of innovation theory with constructs from institutional theory; 4) include tactics novel to US public health practice (e.g., use of knowledge brokers); 5) use social network analysis and qualitative needs assessment together with traditional statistical modeling for a comprehensive understanding of the predictors of EBPP adoption; and 6) use a stakeholder-driven, flexible "menu" approach from which to select a set of D&I activities that have the greatest salience and feasibility among the LHDs enrolled in our D&I trial. This research is expected to result in a replicable D&I model that can significantly impact diabetes and chronic disease control among LHDs.

Abstract:	Individuals of low socioeconomic (SES) and ethnic minority status, including Hispanics, the largest U.S. ethnic minority group, are disproportionately affected by diabetes. Poor healthcare access and cultural barriers prevent optimal care, adherence, and clinical benefit, thus placing Hispanics at high risk for costly diabetes complications. Our established academic-healthcare-community partnership has unique experience in developing and testing innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable chronic care interventions to reduce disparities and improve health in underserved communities. We recently developed Dulce Digital (i.e., "one-size-fits-all" educational text messages, with nurse monitoring of patient-transmitted blood glucose values), which improved glycemic control across 6 months, relative to usual care in a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) of N=126 Hispanic patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Our process evaluation indicated that Dulce Digital was both feasible and acceptable from patient and provider perspectives; however, patients expressed a preference for a more individualized intervention, and providers requested an even greater focus on health behavior change. Thus, the proposed RCT will examine the comparative effectiveness of Dulce Digital versus "Dulce Digital-Me" (DD-Me) in N=414 Hispanic adults of low SES with poorly controlled T2DM from Neighborhood Healthcare, a San Diego federally qualified health center. Guided by patient and provider feedback, DD-Me includes Dulce Digital components plus personalized goal-setting and feedback that is responsive to the individual's needs and preferences. The DD-Me adaptive feedback component will be informed by the Resources and Support for Self-Management Model and Operant Conditioning Theory, and based on the individual's progress on intermediate behavioral targets (i.e., medication adherence assessed by wireless sensor; brief mobile phone-based assessments of diet, physical activity, stress). Feedback will be delivered via algorithm-driven automated messaging in 50% of DD-Me participants and by the care team medical assistant in the remaining half to determine the feasibility and acceptability (given the purported cultural relevance of interpersonal relationships in the Hispanic culture), and the comparative effectiveness and cost of each delivery method. Changes in indicators of diabetes clinical control (i.e., glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], systolic blood pressure [SBP]), patient-provider communication, and patient adherence (i.e., to medication and other diabetes self-management behaviors) will be evaluated across twelve months. Thorough process and cost-effectiveness analyses will evaluate the scalability and sustainability potential of DD-Me. Our comparative evaluation of two mHealth approaches will elucidate how technology can be integrated most effectively and efficiently within existing nurse-led chronic care approaches to meet the complex needs of underserved individuals with poorly controlled T2DM.

Abstract:	Patients with type two diabetes (T2D) frequently lead sedentary life styles, which is not only a risk factor for diabetes, but can also exacerbate the disease. Recommending increased physical activity is therefore a cornerstone of T2D prevention and management. Historically, increasing activity was synonymous with exercise; however, we now know that even much more modest activity levels (e.g., simply walking) or merely decreasing the proportion of sedentary time may be sufficient to improve health outcomes. Some interventions designed to increase activity have shown promise; others have been less successful. The availability of inexpensive pedometers, and, more recently, low-cost triaxial accelerometers, has now made it much easier to monitor activity levels and provide feedback to users. These devices are ideal for capturing activity associated with walking, the most popular and acceptable form of exercise for patients with T2D, but only if patients actually wear them. Thus, there is a need to develop pragmatic approaches that encourage patients to not only wear these monitoring devices, but also to motivate them to increase their activity. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop new practical, affordable, and easy-to-use approaches to increase activity among patients at risk for developing T2D and those already diagnosed with T2D. To achieve this goal, we will test MapTrek, an mHealth game of our own design that uses low-cost triaxial accelerometers to encourage patients to walk more, and we will test this mHealth intervention against a control group using the accelerometers alone. The data we generate will help inform a larger pragmatic trial to investigate long-term clinical outcomes and costs.

Abstract:	The long-term goal of this project is to address the striking disparities in diabetes and its complications that American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) face. To achieve this goal, effective strategies for diabetes management and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction are urgently needed to decrease morbidity and mortality among AI/ANs and to improve their overall health and quality of life. Case management is an important approach to enhance traditional health care delivery for people at elevated risk of adverse outcomes. It holds great promise for alleviating the heavy diabetes and CVD burden among AI/ANs and other minority populations. However, how to effectively implement this intervention in the real-world settings of large and diverse communities remains unclear. The proposed study will comparatively evaluate the effectiveness of the Healthy Heart demonstration project of Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI-HH), a cardiovascular risk reduction project using an intensive case management (ICM) approach. The efficacy of the ICM approach was already well established, thus, SDPI-HH was designed as a translational project without a control group. The effectiveness of the intervention has been evaluated as a pre- and post-test design which, albeit necessary and informative, provides only a partial assessment of the program's ability to manage diabetes and its complications. In this proposal, the SDPI-HH data will be combined with 2 targeted sources, the Indian Health Service (IHS) Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit data and the data from the Look AHEAD trial, a randomized trial comparing the impacts of an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) and diabetes support education (DSE) on cardiovascular outcomes among individuals with diabetes. The specific aims of this project are (1) using IHS Audit data, to broaden the understanding of SDPI-HH effectiveness by comparing the trends of diabetes quality of care between HH and non-HH facilities from 1998 to 2013; and (2) using data from the Look AHEAD trial and employing a propensity score matching approach, to compare the effectiveness of SDPIICM intervention with the Look AHEAD ILI and DSE approaches among patients with diabetes. Our proposed analytic strategy has the potential to reduce or eliminate potential biases present in a one-arm pre- and post-test design that is frequently the only option in community-based translational intervention initiatives. Not only will the resulting findings provide critical guidance as we seek to reduce CVD risks among AI/ANs with diabetes, they will also demonstrate ways in which publicly available public health surveillance and/or historical control data may assist in evaluating similar community-based interventions.

Abstract:	The Foundation's initiative, New Connections: Bringing Diversity to RWJF Grantmaking and Increasing Secondary Data Analyses, was designed to address needs for data that can inform the Foundation's program planning or measure progress toward its strategic objectives. This research study will explore genetic, metabolic, behavioral, and socioeconomic risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) adolescents. Project aims are to (1) examine risk factors for T2DM in AI/AN adolescents and young adults; (2) determine the proportion of T2DM that is due to each risk factor; and (3) explore the longitudinal patterns of body mass index and its mediation of other risk factors for T2DM. The researcher will conduct secondary analyses of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, which has the largest longitudinal sample of AI/AN adolescents and young adults in the US. The researcher's career development activities will include participation in the New Connections Annual Symposium and advanced methods courses at the University of Washington's Department of Epidemiology. Deliverables will include two abstracts for conference presentations and two manuscripts for submission to peer-reviewed journals.

Abstract:	Current guidelines for diabetes care recommend individualized treatment plans for complex patients since tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate. However, little evidence exists to support patient-centered decisions. Electronic health records (EHRs) provide an important source for clinical evidence on improving diabetes care, but suffer from usability deficiencies. In particular, lab measures and vital signs have intermittent missing values where irregular visit patterns may be informative about patients' underlying medication status. Patient characteristics are also incomplete due to linkage error. We aim to impute missing values in EHRs and improve data quality to strengthen the evidence base for diabetes guidelines. The proposed work is motivated by ongoing clinical research to examine the role of patient complexity in the relationship between tight A1c control and the risk of adverse events, using a pre-existing EHR dataset of 8,304 patients with diabetes cared by UW Health during 2003-2011. We propose Bayesian latent profile models under multiple imputation to account for the potentially non-ignorable visiting process, facilitate modeling a large number of EHR variables of mixed types, and develop scalable computation algorithms. Specifically, first we will build latent profiles by jointly modeling A1c values, patient characteristics, and health outcomes. Second, we will generalize the latent profiles by multiple pattern indices and combine the trajectories of multiple lab measures and vital signs with intermittent missing values, as well as account for incomplete patient sociodemographics. Third, we will release open source computation software and disseminate new clinical findings to the health care delivery system. The investigation results will advance statistical methodology development for missing data in longitudinal studies, increase the compatibility of available patient medical records and strengthen the evidence base to support existing diabetes guidelines.

Abstract:	Type 2 diabetes disproportionately affects U.S. racial/ethnic minorities, as evidenced by a higher prevalence of the condition and its complications among Hispanics, blacks, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans compared to whites. In October 2015, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released a new recommendation to screen asymptomatic adults who are 40-70 years old and overweight/obese for diabetes and prediabetes (collectively called dysglycemia). These screening criteria are likely to identify proportionately fewer cases of dysglycemia among racial/ethnic minorities, who experience higher risk at younger ages and lower body weights compared to whites. By contrast, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screening in adults with at least two diabetes risk factors, including non-white race/ethnicity. Screening criteria are based on models that use risk factors to predict the development of dysglycemia. However, existing risk models have limited application in practice because they include data that are not routinely collected, and they do not accurately predict dysglycemia in racial/ethnic minorities. Using data from a national network of community health centers whose patients are predominantly racial/ethnic minorities, this timely research will investigate the assessment of diabetes risk and the effectiveness of alternate screening criteria. The Alliance of Chicago Community Health Services (Alliance) is a national data warehouse for over 200 community health centers, which links sociodemographic, laboratory, and health care utilization data from the electronic health records (EHR) of over 800,000 patients. Using longitudinal Alliance data from 2006 to 2015, we will compare the performance of three different approaches for predicting dysglycemia, based on 1) USPSTF criteria, 2) ADA criteria, and 3) criteria from a novel risk prediction model we will develop using the same EHR data. In a second aim, we will estimate and compare the costs and short-term cost-effectiveness of screening based on the same sets of criteria. This economic analysis is essential to promote the uptake of optimal diabetes screening approaches in practice. Findings from this study can be used to improve diabetes screening recommendations to better identify high-risk individuals, especially racial/ethnic minorities. This study may therefore help reduce racial/ethnic disparities by detecting dysglycemia earlier in these groups, so that prevention and treatment strategies can be initiated. In addition, this study will lead to future research that tests novel interventions for screening, diagnosing, and treating dysglycemia, and examines the long-term cost effectiveness of screening approaches. Our multidisciplinary team has extensive expertise in the content areas and methods needed to successfully conduct the proposed secondary data analysis, and then investigate the application of study findings in practice. This study is timely in its examination of new diabetes screening criteria; novel in its inclusion of a large, minority-predominant patient sample; and significant in its potential to maximize both population health and health equity in diabetes.

Abstract:	Evidence demonstrates the benefits of diabetes self-management education (DSME) on diabetes knowledge and self-care behavior, clinical outcomes, quality of life, use of primary and preventive services, and lower costs. While the initial benefits of DSME are well documented, the effects decline approximately six months following DSME. Additionally, the majority of studies in this area are singularly focused and comparisons between multiple approaches are limited. The 2012 National Standards for DSME and Support emphasize the importance of providing both initial DSME and ongoing diabetes self-management support (DSMS) to assist people with diabetes in maintaining effective self-management throughout a lifetime. While a great deal is understood about how to provide effective DSME, less is known about how to provide effective DSMS. Additionally, DSME is a covered benefit in the health care system, while DSMS is not. This ultimately limits access and availability of DSMS programs, therefore posing a critical need to develop, evaluate, and understand effective DSMS models that are ongoing, patient-driven, responsive to change, and embedded in existing community infrastructures. African American churches are a potentially effective venue for delivering such interventions. The goal of this proposal is to examine the effectiveness of three DSMS approaches compared to enhanced usual care within the context of churches. A cluster randomized, practical behavioral trial with three parallel intervention groups will be implemented. Twenty-one churches in metro-Detroit will be randomized to either 1) Parish Nurse+Peer Leader DSMS, 2) Parish Nurse DSMS, or 3) Peer Leader DSMS. All participants will begin with enhanced usual care and transition into the respective DSMS groups based on church membership. Each church will enroll 20-23 individuals with type 2 diabetes, who will be offered six weeks of DSME, followed by 12 months of support group sessions led by either the parish nurse, peer leader, or a combination of both. Following DSMS, all participants and churches will transition into a one-year period of ongoing support to evaluate if participants, parish nurses, and peer leaders sustain self-management efforts by capitalizing on the infrastructure of the church. We hypothesize that 1) participants in both Parish Nurse DSMS and Peer Leader DSMS will have improved outcomes over enhanced usual care and that 2) participants in Parish Nurse+Peer Leader DSMS will sustain improvements in outcomes achieved following DSME at significantly higher levels than participants in Parish Nurse DSMS and Peer Leader DSMS. We anticipate that providing formal infrastructure and supervision for peer leaders is critical in the uptake of DSMS. All interventions will be superior to enhanced usual care. A similar pattern of findings is anticipated for blood pressure, weight, and quality of life. The cost-effectiveness and long-term impact of each approach will be determined. This information will have significant public health impact and will be pivotal in determining effective sustainable strategies and approaches to address DSMS in underserved communities.

Abstract:	In September 2015, the University of Michigan (U of M) changed its health care benefits to cover interventions for weight reduction and diabetes prevention at no out-of-pocket cost for the ~20,000 overweight or obese employees, dependents, and retirees with prediabetes among its ~85,000 employees, dependents, and retirees. We will evaluate the impact of this large-scale policy change on population health by first comparing the yield of four strategies being used to identify nondiabetic employees, dependents, and retirees with prediabetes. These strategies include using claims, HbA1c, and BMI levels available in the U of M's self-funded health insurance database to identify prediabetic individuals; applying a validated screening algorithm to the same database to identify additional nondiabetic individuals >=40 years of age at highest risk for prediabetes for HbA1c testing; by asking individuals to self-screen for prediabetes using the CDC Prediabetes Screening Test (and to have HbA1c testing if positive); and by performing prediabetes screening and HbA1c testing as part of a worksite wellness program. We will also evaluate the incremental benefits of tailored feedback, engaging primary care physicians in case finding, and financial incentives for member participation in screening. Second, we will describe intervention uptake and reach and assess individual preferences for in-person and internet-based lifestyle interventions and for metformin therapy. We will attempt to explain intervention participation based on the health belief model, and further describe and compare the uptake, adherence, retention, and change in outcomes (weight, BMI, HbA1c, and quality of life) associated with each intervention. We will also assess the impact of the interventions on population health. Finally, we will model the effectiveness, costs, and cost-utility of the interventions relative to no intervention over one and two years and over simulated 5- and 10-year time horizons using a validated computer simulation model. The rigorous evaluation of this large-scale change in obesity policy will involve collaboration among the research group, patients, providers, provider groups, intervention providers, the U of M, and its health insurer. The results of the evaluation will advance scientific knowledge and will have major implications for benefit design, health policy, and population health.

Abstract:	The "Diabetes Education Self-Management for Ongoing and Newly Diagnosed" (DESMOND) program was developed in the UK to help people live with their diabetes. It has been shown to be beneficial for a number of ethnic minority groups in the UK and has been trialed in Australia. At the request of Indigenous community and health care services, this project will test whether this program would be widely accepted by and be beneficial to Indigenous Australians.

Abstract:	During the transition to adult care, patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) risk loss to follow-up care, decreased frequency of clinic attendance, increased rate of diabetes related hospitalizations, and poorer post-transition glycemic control, all of which can have negative long-term consequences for patients. Although well-coordinated health care services are crucial during this period of a patient's life, there is a good deal of variation in how the transition to adult care is structured across different centres in Canada, with little evidence supporting the adoption of any particular model of transition care. A topic not well explored in relation to diabetes transition is the potential role that primary care can play in improving the transition experience for emerging adults with T1D. Our project has three main parts. First, we will survey the 36 pediatric diabetes centres in Ontario and pediatric diabetes clinics in Newfoundland to explore the current model of transition care services that are being employed. Second, we will link these different models to hospitalization and primary care physician usage data to explore the impact of both transition and the various models of care on patient outcomes. In the third part of the project, we will conduct focus groups with patients with T1D who have recently transitioned into adult care and interview family physicians to discuss their experience with transition and ways that family physicians can play a bigger role supporting youth adults with T1D. It is hoped that this work will give us more information about how patients with T1D are being treated as they move into adult care, that we can identify programs or centres that seem to be doing this better, and that we can identify interventions we can try to improve the experience of young adults with T1D, and maybe even for other patients with chronic conditions transferring into adult care.

Abstract:	As a result of globalization and economic advancement, countries like South Africa (SA) are experiencing a "risk transition" in which disease prevalence is shifting from being primarily infectious in nature to being primarily non-communicable in nature. This is presenting significant challenges for the health care systems of countries with scarce resources. In the U.S., evidence from large, rigorous RCTs clearly indicate that lifestyle interventions such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) can enable overweight individuals to change their diet and physical activity levels and significantly reduce their risk for diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular (CVD) diseases, but the program has not been adapted for delivery in a developing word setting. The purpose of this proposal is to adapt the DPP and evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness in an urban settlement community in SA. Three initial adaptations to the DPP are proposed for this setting: (1) deliver treatment in a group format using community health workers (CHWs); (2) enhance the DPP through interactive text messaging; and (3) enhance CHWs' communications skills through simplified motivational interviewing (MI) training. The RE-AIM model will be used to guide our intervention adaptations in order to maximize public health impact. Feasibility and effectiveness of the DPP-SA will be assessed in a "real world" trial using a large team of CHWs currently deployed in this community to help overweight/obese individuals with DM and/or CVD. We plan a 2-year cluster randomized trial in which we will randomize 54 existing "health clubs" (N=540) to receive the DPP South Africa (DPP-SA) or usual care (wait-list). The primary outcome analysis will compare percentage of baseline weight loss at Y1 between DPP-SA and usual care; however, after Y1 usual care participants will also receive the DPP-SA and both groups will be followed for another year. This will allow us to assess whether the wait-list group's results after one year of treatment are similar to the original group's outcomes and examine whether the original group maintains its outcomes over two years. Secondary outcomes will include DM and cardiovascular risk indicators (blood pressure, hemoglobin A1C, lipids), changes in medication use, diet (fat and fruit and vegetable intake), physical activity, and health-related quality of life. Feasibility and process outcomes will be assessed among NGO staff, CHWs, and participants. We will also prepare the DPP-SA for dissemination through development of training curricula, establishing university training courses, engaging other stakeholders who are candidates for dissemination, and assessing the cost-effectiveness of the intervention with respect to cost per kg of weight loss and key secondary outcomes.

Abstract:	Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is among the most common chronic conditions of childhood and its management is complex and relentless. Adolescents have increased risk for worsening glycemic control, putting them at risk for short- and long-term complications. As responsibility for daily T1D management tasks begins to shift from parents to youth, supportive parent-adolescent teamwork promotes optimal diabetes outcomes. However, adolescents' cognitive development, desire for autonomy, and changing family and social relationships can make adherence to treatment recommendations difficult and strain attempts at parent-adolescent teamwork. We aim to develop and pilot test a mobile app-based behavioral intervention to facilitate positive, supportive parent-adolescent interactions around T1D management. The proposed study has two parts. First, we plan to involve adolescents with T1D (age 12-17), their parents, and diabetes care providers in designing a smartphone app that supports parents to recognize, keep track of, and reinforce their adolescents for specific positive T1D-related behaviors, or strengths. Example strengths include asking for help with complicated diabetes tasks, talking to friends about diabetes, and expressing confidence or optimism about T1D management. Intermittently throughout the day, the app will push parents a prompt to report which positive T1D behaviors their adolescent has engaged in. The app will generate weekly summary reports of each adolescent's most frequent strength behaviors, and parents will be reminded via the app to praise their adolescent for those patterns. Second, we plan to pilot test this intervention with 82 families; parents will be randomized to an intervention or a control condition. Participants in the intervention condition will use the app for 6 months and provide feedback, and control participants will receive usual care and will not use the app. Our main goal is to determine how often and in what ways families use the app, whether they like it, and to obtain suggestions for improvement. We will also evaluate trends for impact on important diabetes outcomes, such as quality of parent-adolescent relationships, T1D treatment adherence, and glycemic control. Data--including questionnaires, adherence data from blood glucose meters, and glycemic control biomarkers from a blood draw--will be collected at baseline and again 3 and 6 months later. The results of this pilot study will help refine the intervention so that it can be evaluated in a full-scale randomized controlled trial. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to validate brief, convenient, and helpful tools that families of all adolescents with T1D can use to strengthen positive family teamwork and ultimately promote optimal diabetes health outcomes.

Abstract:	Significant racial disparities between non-Hispanic blacks and whites exist in the prevalence of diabetes and the story of John Henry, the "steel-drivin'" man is well known to most black men in the U.S.; and to most, John Henry is a hero because of his relentless determination. John Henryism is defined as a survival strategy developed among newly freed black people, one that endorsed the values of hard work, self-reliance, and high-effort coping--all attributes of successful chronic disease self-management. The goal of this research is to develop a culturally grounded diabetes self-management intervention for adult black men. Black men are identified as a priority group in need of targeted diabetes self-management interventions. The purpose of this application is to create and implement a targeted, culturally grounded, diabetes self-management intervention for black men with type 2 diabetes that uses social support, mobile health, and remote sensing technology to improve diabetes-related outcomes. The primary outcome will be a 0.5% reduction in A1C levels following the intervention. Secondary outcomes will include reductions in diabetes complication risk factors of blood pressure, waist circumference, and cholesterol. Additional outcomes include medication adherence, blood glucose monitoring, and physical activity. The 10-week intervention is comprised of three components: (1) ten group-based social support meetings that will include the formation of two-man partnerships ("buddies"); (2) a remote-sensing health behavioral technology, the cloud-based Telcare glucometer to facilitate objective monitoring of health behavior; and (3) development of gender-sensitive, culturally grounded text messages designed to motivate and remind participants to engage in recommended self-management behaviors. Year one is devoted to designing the group intervention and developing and testing the set of targeted text messages by drawing upon self-determination theory, the diabetes empowerment approach, and research on John Henryism. Given its broad recognition and endorsement among black men, the story of John Henry and research on John Henryism holds tremendous promise as a conceptual foundation for engaging black men in a health promotion program. Year two will test the 10-week intervention using a wait-listed control (the men will serve as their own control), repeated measures single-arm design (three points in time) with 40 black men. The study also includes a three-month post-intervention follow-up assessment. Pragmatically, we have chosen to focus on behavior that can be influenced by one-to-one partnerships and small groups. As this targeted research program develops, we will incorporate the influence of family systems and neighborhood contexts within which black men operate. In summary, black men with type 2 diabetes can benefit from applying the principles of self-determination, diabetes empowerment, and John Henryism to their own health challenges. The proposed research will develop a gender targeted self-management intervention to assist adult black men in controlling diabetes through social support and mobile health technology.

Abstract:	Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most expensive chronic disease in the U.S. Lifestyle modification is central to T2DM management, but long-term adherence to dietary recommendations is difficult. A key challenge is the difficulty of coping with cravings for high carbohydrate or sugar-laden foods in an environment where these foods are tempting and widely available. One mechanism by which mindfulness may increase long-term dietary adherence is by better equipping individuals with skills to experience food cravings and difficult emotions without eating in response. Such approaches seek to strengthen abilities to be non-judgmentally aware of, tolerate, and respond skillfully to food cravings and difficult emotions without reacting impulsively or maladaptively. We hypothesize that improved ability to manage food cravings and emotional eating is a key mechanism through which mindfulness enhancements can improve dietary adherence. We will test mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) components for improving dietary adherence based on our group's recent National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)-funded trial testing MBI components for obesity, which showed evidence of improved fasting glucose, lipids, and potentially weight. Although the particular diet employed is not the focus of this study, we plan to use a diet with about 10% of calories from carbohydrate as (1) it induces a low level of ketone production, which we will use as a biomarker for dietary adherence; and (2) prior studies suggest it improves metabolic parameters in T2DM, including glycemic control. Methods: We will use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods to measure eating in response to difficult emotions and/or food cravings. In the R61 phase, we will ensure this measure is appropriate for further testing and assess the impact of the MBI components on our hypothesized behavioral mechanisms in N=45 persons with T2DM. We plan 3 waves of 15 persons each, with 12 weekly sessions. All participants will attend an in-person group course providing education on basic behavioral strategies for diet and physical activity. Participants will be randomized to receive this education alone (Ed) or this same material with added MBI components (Ed+MBI). We will also pilot test two levels of intensity of maintenance phase intervention (monthly group meetings alone or supplemented by individualized attention) to prepare them for R33 testing. We plan an R33 phase trial in which 120 persons with T2DM will be randomized (using a 1:2 ratio) to Ed or Ed+MBI conditions and followed for 12 months, including a 9-month maintenance phase. We will test the effects of MBI components on our proposed behavioral mechanisms and dietary adherence and obtain preliminary data on MBI component effects on weight and glycemic control. We will use an innovative adaptive intervention design to optimize maintenance phase intensity, which we believe may be key to augment the MBI effects. Significance: Our studies promise to extend our understanding of how MBI components can improve dietary adherence and have broader implications for understanding the mechanisms of MBIs for other conditions such as addiction.

Abstract:	Despite the availability of evidence-based strategies to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), engagement in these strategies is low among at-risk veterans. A key opportunity to engage at-risk veterans in interventions to prevent T2DM is when they are informed they have prediabetes. It remains unclear how VHA communications to patients diagnosed with prediabetes could be optimized to improve their engagement in evidence-based preventive strategies. Objectives: Aim 1 is to describe at-risk veterans' current engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM and the mediators of this engagement. Aim 2 is to examine the effects of receipt of a prediabetes diagnosis on at-risk veterans' weight and engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM. Aim 3 is to identify the effects of 5 strategies from behavioral economics and health psychology on weight, HbA1c, and engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM among veterans with prediabetes. Methods: To accomplish aim 1, we surveyed 369 non-diabetic veterans with risk factors for T2DM about their engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM and mediators of this engagement, such as risk perception, motivation, and awareness of and preferences for preventive strategies. To accomplish aim 2, we are conducting a pilot randomized trial among 315 non-diabetic veterans from project 1 in which 252 of these veterans were randomly assigned to undergo screening for T2DM using a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test. The 107 veterans who were found to have HbA1c values in the prediabetes range received that diagnosis and preventive recommendations via brief standardized counseling. All 315 veterans are having their weight tracked over the next year and are being surveyed immediately after the screening and brief counseling process, at 3 months, and at 1 year. In our analyses we will compare changes in weight, engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM, and mediators of this engagement between the 107 veterans found to have prediabetes and the 63 veterans who were not screened. Among the 107 veterans with prediabetes, we conducted 20 semi-structured interviews to gain insights into the effects of this diagnosis and brief counseling. To accomplish aim 3, we are conducting a factorial design experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of 5 innovative strategies from behavioral economics and health psychology in promoting initial engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM among 144 veterans who at baseline had a recent HbA1c test result in the prediabetes range but were not engaged in an evidence-based strategy to prevent T2DM. Impact: Prevention of T2DM is an important way to improve veterans' health and limit the burden of T2DM on the VHA. In this CDA, we will identify new opportunities for improving veteran engagement in evidence-based ways to prevent T2DM. Insights generated from this research will be exportable to other high-priority conditions in which veteran engagement in preventive behaviors is essential and could be improved.

Abstract:	Emotional distress, including depression and diabetes-specific distress (e.g., feeling overwhelmed by living with diabetes, feelings of failure related to diabetes self-care), is a significant and prevalent problem for patients with type 2 diabetes. Both depression and diabetes distress have been associated with metabolic/glycemic control, diabetes complications, mortality, and quality of life. Recent findings further suggest that risk for emotional distress is influenced by diabetes treatment. The GRADE study (Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study) is generating prospective data that will provide a unique opportunity to examine the relationships between emotional distress, diabetes treatment, and outcomes in an experimental design. The GRADE study is a randomized clinical trial that will compare the metabolic effects of four common anti-diabetic drugs when combined with metformin. This sub-study will recruit a total of 2,500 patients who are within ten years of diagnosis and are being treated with metformin monotherapy at the time of enrollment. The study will examine patient-level variation in baseline emotional distress as a predictor of glycemic control and other health outcomes, independent of treatment effects. The study will also provide a rigorous experimental examination of treatment regimen effects on emotional distress over time as part of the overall evaluation of comparative effectiveness. Evaluation of emotional distress using well-validated measures will allow us to disentangle the roles of depressive symptoms and diabetes distress, factors that share significant overlap but require distinct approaches to screening and treatment. Study findings will directly inform practice decisions regarding screening and treatment for emotional distress as part of diabetes care.

Abstract:	Improving health care quality for seniors with diabetes is a critical issue for clinicians, health care systems, and policy makers. The Medicare STAR program is the primary way in which the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) monitors quality of care for seniors with diabetes in health plans caring for Medicare enrollees. CMS attaches significant monetary incentives to these Medicare STAR measures for health plans, distributing millions of dollars to plans annually based on STAR results. A recent change in CMS policy introduced three new diabetes-relevant metrics to the Medicare STAR portfolio in 2012: adherence to oral antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic, and antihypertensive medications. Current guidelines apply these metrics to all Medicare beneficiaries older than 18, with no upper age limit and no adjustment for the number or type of comorbidities patients experience. Quality metrics for patients with chronic illness are generally based on clinical trial evidence of reduced risk for clinical outcomes like cardiovascular events or stroke, and are conducted in younger study populations with few or no comorbidities. These data may not be generalizable or even appropriate for elderly patients, who often have multiple concurrent conditions and who may place a higher value on maintaining quality of life. Whether the CMS-defined adherence measures are sufficiently linked to CVD risk factor control outcomes for elderly diabetes patients, especially those with multiple comorbidities, is unknown. In addition, when applied to complex and elderly patients, quality metrics designed to increase medication adherence may increase adverse outcomes such as hypoglycemia and hypotension that reduce quality of life. The objective of this application is to leverage a secondary data source of over 120,000 diabetes patients over the age of 65 to assess how adherence to diabetes oral medications, statins, and blood pressure medications impact safety and outcomes for Medicare patients with diabetes, and to examine how these effects are influenced by the presence of key comorbidities. The specific aims of this research are to examine the impact of advanced age and specific comorbidities on meeting defined levels of adherence to CVD risk factor medications in diabetes patients; to compare the effectiveness of meeting adherence targets on CVD risk factor control, adverse events, and health care utilization; and to disseminate the study's findings to a wide range of clinical, operational, and policy stakeholders. This study will help lay a strong foundation for developing patient-centered diabetes quality metrics for the nation's growing Medicare population.

Abstract:	Over 230,000 women are estimated to be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014, and one in five will have type II diabetes. Poorer outcomes are apparent for patients with both conditions, with a 52% increased risk of overall mortality. Even with such high prevalence of co-occurrence, there is limited information about whether and why outcomes may be worse in women with both breast cancer and diabetes versus only breast cancer; there is even less information for how best to treat these patients considering the interaction of the diseases and their treatments. For example, tamoxifen and carboplatin, adjuvant chemotherapy agents for breast cancer, may worsen diabetic neuropathy. Delayed wound healing in patients with diabetes may impact chemotherapy optimal timing. Corticosteroids to control vomiting during chemotherapy may elevate blood sugar and complicate diabetes management. Women with diabetes use mammography screening less. Metformin for diabetes may improve therapeutic response in breast cancer. Clearly, care decisions are more complex when patients have more than one serious health condition, and their interaction begs for a systematic evaluation. Accordingly, our aims and associated hypotheses are 1) to determine how diabetes impacts the breast cancer quality of care; 2) to determine the impact of diabetes-related variations in breast cancer care on recurrence and breast-cancer-specific and overall mortality; and 3) to determine how breast cancer affects diabetes quality of care in breast cancer patients with diabetes. We will collect comprehensive and granular data on a large sample of patients affected by both diseases, and therefore maximize the potential for evaluating the above aims and hypotheses. In order to improve care for multimorbid patients and to better understand how and why patients with breast cancer and diabetes have worse outcomes than those without diabetes, we will analyze two complementary cohorts of subjects with breast cancer: the linked SEER-Medicare data, including hospital, outpatient, physician, and medication claims for women ages 66-85 years; and richly detailed clinical data from an integrated delivery system, Group Health in Western Washington State for women ages 50-85 years. Employing innovative statistical methods on two datasets, one with broad generalizability and one with highly detailed clinical information, we will evaluate what factors most impact health outcomes in breast cancer patients with and without pre-existing diabetes and whether diabetes mediates racial/ethnic inequities in breast cancer treatment and outcomes. The analyses will use innovative statistical methods to tease apart the complexities of simultaneous disease management. This innovative study will help inform optimal care coordination and evidence-based interventions in order to reduce avoidable morbidity and mortality from breast cancer and diabetes. This work also builds a platform for evaluating the interaction between cancer and other burdensome co-existing comorbidities.

Abstract:	Background: Patient-centered outcomes research is meant to enable patients to make informed health care decisions, based on the patients' conditions, characteristics, and preferences. To make conscious decisions, patients should be informed of the potential outcomes for all possible treatment options. Using these outcomes and based on the patients' preferences, the optimal treatment can be identified. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for identifying optimal treatment options. However, RCTs usually compare two treatments on a small homogenous group of patients. Thus, observational data are the main tool to identify the optimal treatment among several when applied to a large cohort. Objectives: This proposal is aimed at testing and providing guidance for utilization of statistical methods aimed at estimation of optimal treatment among a group of three or more treatments. This method will provide researchers with guidelines for choosing the most appropriate statistical method when comparing more than three treatments. We will also develop new methods for estimation, when currently used methods are inadequate. Future directions of this project will address extension of this analysis to compare multiple treatments when the effects are heterogeneous. Methods: We will use extensive simulation analyses that are based on plausible realistic settings to examine current as well as newly proposed procedures for estimating treatment effect with multiple treatments. These simulations will allow us to identify the optimal method that should be used by investigators based on their own questions and datasets. Anticipated impact: We will provide guidelines for statistical procedures aimed at estimating treatment effects from observational data that include multiple treatments. We will also provide software implementing the possible methods for use by other researchers. In addition, we will apply the proposed methods to an important medical question that will examine the effects of non-insulin antihyperglycemic treatment regimens (mono-/poly-therapy) on the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. If the estimates produced by the different methods are different, we will rely on the conclusions from the simulation analysis to justify the method that should be used.

Abstract:	Policymakers and the American public need to know whether the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is increasing access to effective health care, and which specific resources are working. The ACA was implemented through a cluster of federal grants to the states that varied in topic and size, making it difficult to assess the impact of individual funding components across states. For example, targeted funds to establish state-based exchanges support Medicaid expansions, and assist consumers post-enrollment were accepted in some states, but not in others. Decoupling the effects of these components is critical for policymaking. To make decisions about how to prioritize spending in the future, policymakers need to know what has worked in the past. One important effect of the ACA could be increasing use of effective medications for diabetes and hypertension, two chronic conditions which affect millions of Americans and can be controlled through medications. As such, the overall aim of this project is to measure the impact of four state-varying components of the ACA--Medicaid expansions, state-based marketplace implementation, and funding for pre-enrollment and post-enrollment assistance programs--on prescription fills for diabetes and hypertension, using geographic variation to identify causal effects. By using two methods, I can reach more precise conclusions about how the components build on one another. Specifically, I will (specific aim 1) use a parametric (regression) approach to estimate the causal impact of state-varying components of the ACA on prescription fills for diabetes and hypertension. Because the state-varying components of the ACA were not randomly assigned to states, I will correct for time-varying political, economic, and health-related determinants of state-level decisions as well as time-invariant factors, and implement additional corrections if tests suggest it is necessary. To distinguish changes in prescription use due to improved access to care from changes in disease prevalence, I will correct for the need for prescriptions using estimates of self-reported diabetes from CDC and estimates of total hypertension from my previous research; and (specific aim 2) use a semi-parametric (matching) approach to conduct an extensive robustness check of the estimates. Some counties at state borders are similar in many ways but subjected to vastly different ACA implementations. Using these counties, I can calculate the same causal effects as in specific aim 1 but using a matched-pairs difference-in-differences approach. Although this method is less standard in the health literature, it uses fewer assumptions about how the state-varying components of the ACA build on one another. Policymakers need to know which resources related to the ACA had impact on access to effective health care. The goal of this project is to provide precisely this information. By employing two methods, I will be able to reach robust conclusions about the incremental impact of four state-varying components of the ACA.

Abstract:	Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has escalated to epidemic proportion and can cause maternal and child complications. GDM is a significant maternal risk factor for subsequent development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and places the fetus at increased risk for congenital morbidity/mortality and for future onset of diabetes. American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) women are twice as likely to develop GDM and T2D, mostly due to health care disparities (e.g., limited access to resources, lack of culturally relevant programs). The need for an inexpensive accessible GDM intervention in this population is compelling. The intervention should be delivered during adolescence and prior to sexual debut. Preconception counseling (PC) prevents unplanned pregnancies and significantly reduces risks of complications. If GDM in a previous pregnancy is an indicator of high risk in subsequent pregnancies, then preventing GDM in a first pregnancy is imperative. For a significant and innovative shift in paradigm, we propose a primary prevention PC intervention for AI/AN adolescent females at risk for GDM to enhance healthy lifestyle behaviors and family planning vigilance prior to this first pregnancy. We will target girls starting at the age of 12 to coincide with both the coming-of-age rituals for AI/AN girls during which many receive womanly advice from elder female family members, and the American Diabetes Association recommendation that PC in all females should start at puberty. This new directive will require support from the teens' mothers (or their female caregiver) and well-informed community health care professionals (HCP). Our objective is to adapt our current PC intervention (validated for teens with diabetes) using a sequential mixed-method design with a multi-tribal AI/AN community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach (e.g., Navajo, Cherokee, 40 Oklahoma tribes; 8 project members are AI/AN) by first using focus groups of teens, mothers, HCP, and Tribal leaders; and then testing this culturally appropriate PC theory-based intervention named STOP-GDM in AI/AN adolescent females 12 to < 20 years at risk for GDM (e.g., pre-diabetes or BMI > 85%). Teens and their mothers will receive STOP-GDM to raise their awareness of the risks of GDM and benefits of a healthy lifestyle to reduce these risks. By also providing mothers with PC knowledge and skills they can naturally weave cultural/social influences into their communications with their daughters. The multi-level intervention will be directed at the individual, familial, and institutional levels simultaneously. AI/AN community-researcher partnerships have been established. A randomized controlled trial with a 15-month follow-up will test the effects of receiving online STOP-GDM on mother-daughter (M-D) cognitive/psychosocial and behavioral outcomes, and daughter family planning vigilance. The final online STOP-GDM program will be provided at no cost to the Indian Health Service (IHS) for dissemination to all their sites. HCPs at each clinical facility will be given free access to a continuing education program for PC training. This proposal provides a unique opportunity for a broad dissemination to significantly impact all IHS AI/AN female teens at risk for GDM, and help to prevent them and their future children from developing T2D.

Abstract:	Background: Veterans with diabetes must control cardiovascular risk factors in order to prevent disabling and life-threatening complications. However, despite system-wide advances in diabetes quality of care, over 30% of VHA patients with diabetes continue to have uncontrolled blood pressure, hyperglycemia, or hyperlipidemia. The nationwide VA PACT (Patient-Aligned Care Teams) initiative seeks to provide patients comprehensive, team-based support for following diabetes care regimens. PACT's success, however, hinges on its ability to effectively engage patients in care. One relatively untapped resource for supporting engagement in PACT is the patients' family and friends. Three out of four adults with diabetes reach out to an unpaid family member or friend (a "Care Partner") for ongoing help with diabetes management. These supporters help patients with medication adherence, tracking home glucose measurements, maintaining a healthy eating plan, and they often accompany patients to their medical visits. However, while PACT emphasizes the importance of family members as part of the care team, PACT does not have formal mechanisms to involve health supporters in PACT care. Health supporters report that, in order to be more effective, they need more information on patients' medical care plans, clear channels for communicating with PACT team members, and information on navigating PACT resources. Objectives: The overall objective of this randomized trial is to test a strategy to strengthen the capacity of supporters to help patients with high-risk diabetes engage in PACT care and successfully enact care plans. The central hypothesis is that providing health care engagement tools to both Care Partners and patients will increase patient activation and improve management of diabetes complication risks. Methods: This will be a randomized controlled trial evaluating an intervention (Caring Others Increasing EngageMent in PACT, or CO-impact) designed to structure and facilitate health supporter involvement in PACT so that patients can become more actively engaged in PACT care. 240 patients with diabetes receiving PACT primary care who 1) are at high risk for diabetes complications due to hyperglycemia OR high blood pressure, and 2) have a health supporter involved in their care will be recruited along with their health supporter. Patient-supporter dyads will be randomized to the CO-impact intervention or usual PACT care for high-risk diabetes for 12 months. The intervention provides patient-supporter dyads: one coaching session on action planning, communicating with providers, navigation skills and support skills; preparation by phone before patients' primary care visits; after-visit summaries by mail; and biweekly automated phone calls to prompt action on new patient health concerns. CO-impact builds on medical record-integrated patient activation tools in the PACT toolkit and is designed to be implementable within existing PACT nurse encounters. Primary outcomes for this study include a validated measure of patient activation (Patient Activation Measure-13) and a cardiac event 5-year risk score designed for patients with diabetes (UKPDS Risk Engine). Secondary outcomes include patients' self-efficacy for diabetes self-care; diabetes self-management behaviors including medication adherence; diabetes distress; and glycemic and blood pressure control. Measures among supporters include supporter activation, use of effective support techniques, distress about patient's diabetes care, and caregiver burden. We will also measure patient-supporter and patient-provider relationship quality, patient safety (e.g. hypoglycemia), utilization, potential moderators of intervention effect such as patient health literacy level, and facilitators and barriers to wider implementation. Findings: This study has not yet begun recruitment. No findings statement. Impact: If successful, the study will establish a new approach for involving patients' supporters in VA care, in ways that could avert devastating consequences of uncontrolled diabetes. Similar methods could be used by the VA to better support veterans' family caregivers, and to improve health management for veterans with other high-risk conditions.

Abstract:	Type 1 diabetes is associated with information deluge. Individuals are collecting enormous amounts of data, including glucose, insulin, and carbohydrate data, yet the extent to which this information is being utilized for developing insights about self-management in diabetes is limited. The majority of patients do not utilize data visualization displays in their self-management, as most data displays are static and often display blood glucose numbers without providing additional information or insights related to the data visualization. There are a variety of new information tools and technologies that facilitate exploration and examination of multiple streams of longitudinal data using interactive visualization techniques. However, most of these displays are used outside of the healthcare setting, have not been evaluated for usability or understanding, and have not had a specific focus on the patient as the user. In addition, with the advent of smartphone technology, there are many additional data streams that are relevant for understanding self-management in diabetes that are easily passively collected, including physical activity levels and physical location, a proxy for environment. However, these additional displays are not traditionally included in data displays for diabetes. Adolescents with type 1 diabetes are the ideal population for innovating a novel personalized data visualization system that integrates large amounts clinical data with contextual data collected from mobile phones using GPS and accelerometry, provides interactive visualizations that tell a story and are engaging, and provides opportunities for greater engagement, insight, and problem solving for improving glycemic control and overall health outcomes. Success of this prototype will lead to advances in interactive health visualizations, advances in interactive technologies for engagement, and the rise of the patient as expert, working in partnership with the healthcare system to improve health.

Abstract:	Background: American Indians (hereafter: Indigenous) have higher rates of diabetes and diabetes-related complications than the general population. It is important for individuals with diabetes to engage in diabetes self-management behaviors (DSMB) to prevent complications and enhance outcomes, and many different social and individual determinants impact the likelihood of performing these behaviors. Despite the breadth of literature investigating factors influencing DSMB, little information describes these behaviors among Indigenous individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and no data were found regarding culturally specific factors impacting them. Aims: The purpose of this study is to determine factors influencing DSMB of Indigenous individuals who are recently diagnosed with T2D. Methods: This cross-sectional study will utilize an adapted form of Andersen's Behavioral Model to examine the predisposing and enabling characteristics impacting DSMB in five upper Midwest Indigenous tribal communities. Participants will be randomly selected from clinic records if they identify as American Indian, are over the age of 18, and have been diagnosed within the past two years with T2D. A total of 256 individuals will be invited to participate. Participants will complete computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI). Data analysis will include descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, regression models, and structural equation modeling. Expected outcomes: This research will enhance the knowledge of rates of engagement in DSMB, and elucidate the factors influencing these behaviors. Results will facilitate future planning of both provider- and community-based interventions to address barriers and facilitators of DSMB. Understanding the complex relationship between individual- and community-level factors will provide impetus for socio-ecological interventions aimed at multiple levels of determinants.

Abstract:	The Institute of Medicine has defined patient-centered care (PCC) as "providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions." This definition is based on the two fundamental characteristics of PCC, patient involvement in and the individualization of patient care. The overarching goal of my research is to move ophthalmic care closer to a shared-decision making model. This grant has been created to reflect the initiation of this process by focusing on establishing PCC for diabetic macular edema (DME). Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among working age adults in the US, with most of the visual impairment resulting from DME. Recently, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents have become the "gold-standard" for treating fovea-involving DME. The visual gains of this treatment, however, come at a cost of increased office visits and intravitreal injections, which can greatly impact a patient's adherence with their treatment. To better address underlying factors affecting patient adherence, this grant's first aim will focus on the influence that patient demographic and insurance characteristics have on initial choice of treatment for diabetic macular edema. To accomplish this, a large, national administrative medical claims database will analyze how baseline patient characteristics (i.e., age, gender, race, insurance type, and out-of-pocket visit costs) can influence the initial treatment choice received by incident DME patients. The second aim will study the influence of choice of initial anti-VEGF therapy on the frequency of visits and injections. Again using the previously mentioned database, cohorts will be created based on patients who initially received ranibizumab or bevacizumab as first-line treatment and will be followed for two years, assessing differences in visit and treatment frequencies over that time. The last aim will formally assess patient preferences for the frequency of office visits and intravitreal injections they receive in relation to the potential visual change that could be expected. This will be done through extensive surveying of DME patients and systematically assessing their preferred outcomes by making them make discrete choices between more frequent care and better vision. Completion of these aims will inform patients, ophthalmologists, and health policy experts about the influences on and outcomes of care provided to DME patients that will allow for a more personalized and patient-centered approach to the treatment offered.

Abstract:	Limited health literacy (HL) places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and its complications, is a marker of vulnerability, and presents a critical clinical and public health problem. To be health literate in the 21st century, patients will need a certain level of linguistic facility, in combination with technical skills, to access services via online patient portals. Our research has shown that DM2 patients with limited HL are actively using patient portals. However, as health care becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications (e.g., secure messages via internet-based patient portals), patients with limited HL may have difficulty communicating electronically with their clinician or understanding their clinician's secure message responses or instructions. For clinicians to electronically provide meaningful and actionable information and support, their secure messages must be written in an easily comprehended style. Few studies have examined how patients with limited HL interact with their health care providers via patient portals. This transdisciplinary proposal, involving a team of health services researchers, health communication scientists, and computational linguists, will focus on a population of ethnically diverse DM2 patients and their primary care providers from 1) a large, integrated group model HMO with a well-developed patient portal, and 2) a county-run, integrated public (safety net) delivery system with a newly launched electronic health record and patient portal. Our study is designed around a conceptual framework promoted most recently by the Institute of Medicine: overcoming the challenges LHL patients face in managing DM2 requires that health care systems, and their clinicians, make accommodations to meet patients' communication needs. The degree of linguistic "mismatch" observed in secure message exchanges between DM2 patients and their providers, measured using computational linguistics, will serve as one indicator of the extent to which providers are, or are not, making such accommodations. Our specific aims are to (aim 1) develop and validate a novel, automated linguistic complexity profile (LCP) to assess secure message content generated by DM2 patients and their providers via patient portals. We will employ natural language processing (NLP) to develop and validate the LCP, based on secure messages and data from >200,000 DM2 patients. The LCP will demonstrate construct validity with patient HL and patient reports of provider communication, and will be associated with DM2 outcomes; (aim 2) examine whether concordance between provider and patient LCP is associated with adherence among DM2 patients newly prescribed insulin or antidepressants; (aim 3) characterize the collaborative nature of exchanges between providers and low LCP patients, using mixed methods, to enhance our understanding of communication in the critical period surrounding initiation of insulin or antidepressants; and (aim 4) create an automated, LCP-based prototype to provide real-time feedback to providers while writing secure messages to reduce linguistic complexity and better accommodate DM2 patients' linguistic skills and HL.

Abstract:	Diabetes is a prevalent disease that causes significant morbidity, mortality, and costs. While there is no known cure, complications from diabetes can be minimized by lifestyle and medical interventions. To be maximally impactful, both lifestyle and medical interventions require lifelong, daily actions by patients for self-management of their disease condition, including taking prescribed medications on time and testing their blood sugar levels. The proposed pilot study investigates whether gamified social media with a competitive game element that is used in conjunction with home telemonitoring can be effective in enhancing patients' self-management of diabetes, thereby reducing their HgbA1C levels and increasing their diabetes self-efficacy. Sixty adult Medicaid patients with poorly controlled diabetes (HgbA1C >7.0%) will be recruited for the study from a partnering urban teaching hospital that operates primary care clinics. Informed consent will be obtained by researchers, and data on blood glucose/HgbA1C levels, demographic, clinical, social networks, and other behavioral and psychosocial variables will be collected at various times during the study through surveys and blood testing. An innovative community health care provider partner will install home telemonitoring equipment (glucometer with Bluetooth connection to a wireless tablet), and centrally monitor daily fasting blood glucose levels. Patients will be randomized equally to control and intervention groups. All patients will be asked to perform daily fasting blood glucose testing throughout the eight-month study period, and compliance with this task along with actual daily blood glucose levels will be monitored. All patients will also receive a social media app on their tablets that will provide self-management reminders to perform glucometry during the first two-month baseline period. Gamification will then be added to patients' tablets in the intervention group only for the second three-month intervention period. On a daily basis, intervention patients will receive anonymous visualizations of their compliance and actual blood glucose levels compared to others in the intervention group for the previous day. Winners will be announced for best performance in the intervention group. Finally, both groups of patients will have their social media app (and gamification) removed from the tablets for the third and final three-month withdrawal period, but be asked to continue performing daily blood glucose testing. Data will be analyzed to investigate whether the gamified social media app used in conjunction with home telemonitoring improves blood glucose levels, HgbA1C levels, and diabetes self-efficacy. We will also investigate whether social influence from patients social networks around their diabetes acts as an antecedent of usage of the proposed technology, and/or as a moderator of the impact of the technology intervention on outcomes. Finally, outcomes from the third three-month withdrawal period will be evaluated to determine whether the intervention resulted in positive habit formation. Demonstration of beneficial health behavior habit formation from the gamified social media app could prove to be a cost-effective strategy to combat this prevalent disease.

Abstract:	To stimulate health system transformation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) launched the State Innovation Model (SIM) Initiative, which since 2013, has invested more than 1 billion dollars in state efforts to plan, pilot test, and implement payment and delivery system reforms. The SIM Initiative is an ongoing, naturally occurring federal-state "policy intervention" that provides financial and technical support to states for development and testing state-led multi-payer health care payment and service delivery models. The goals of this federal-state program are to improve health system performance, improve the quality of patient care, and decrease health care costs for all residents of the state. As states are investing in transformational restructuring of incentives and delivery systems, the SIM Initiative is anticipated to improve health status overall, including diabetes risk and health status in large segments of the community. In order to achieve SIM Initiative goals, most SIM states are focusing on chronic illness, in general, and diabetes, in particular. We propose a natural experiment rigorously designed to optimize the ability to draw causal inferences. Using diverse data from multiple sources we will assess this population-targeted policy to assess outcomes at multiple levels, including state, county, and physician organization and delivery system levels. From 2015 to 2019, we will monitor and track payment and delivery system reforms relevant to preventing, and managing complications of, diabetes. This will be done for 18 purposively sampled states: 6 "Round 1" states, 6 "Round 2" states, and 6 "waiting control" states. Using these policy data, we will develop a taxonomy of state SIM implementation to empirically examine how SIM implementation affects practice implementation of the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model and participation in accountable care organizations (ACOs). We will use propensity score matching of patients in a stepped-wedge research design to examine the impact of the staged implementation of SIM plans across the states. We will estimate the impact of the SIM Initiative on diabetes-related health behaviors (2011-2018) and hospitalizations due to diabetes (2011-2017) for "Round 1" vs. "Round 2" vs. "waiting control states." The influence of delivery system and payment reform activities implemented as part of each states' SIM plan will be explored. Finally, we estimate the economic impact of the SIM Initiative's improvements in diabetes care prevention and management and explore heterogeneity in economic impacts across SIM states. The proposed collaborative project will yield actionable data and analyses to state and local health officials, and public health and health care delivery stakeholders on the impact of the SIM Initiative on improvements on diabetes prevention and management.

Abstract:	Our UCLA team, in partnership with United Healthcare (UHC), proposes to form a cooperative agreement with the CDC and NIDDK to evaluate the impact of two highly innovative programs in Medicaid known as the Accountable Care Communities (ACC) Program and the Health Home (HH) Program. Both programs are delivery system transformations with on-the-ground partnerships to support improvements in care and population management strategies for Medicaid beneficiaries, many of whom have diabetes and other complex care needs. The implementation of the ACC and HH programs by one of the nation's largest for-profit insurance companies who has over 1 million new Medicaid enrollees since 2012, represents a unique and very timely evaluation of real-world interventions. The overall goal of the research is to employ rigorous empirical evaluation of the impact of these innovative programs on the delivery, outcomes, and cost of care for adult Medicaid enrollees with diabetes. Our specific aims are as follows: 1) to evaluate whether the Medicaid ACC Program, which provides on-the-ground partnerships that embed UHC transformation consultants and nurses into practices to support improvements in care, provides access to complete healthcare and community-wide data analytics to support population management, and includes practice-level financial incentives, such as shared savings programs, will lead to improvements in adherence to medications and diabetes processes of care, in A1c and LDL-c control, fewer emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and lower overall costs of care; 2) to evaluate whether the Medicaid HH Program, which targets patients with serious chronic physical and mental health conditions who also have high social needs and high costs of care, and provides them intensive, individualized care management from an integrated team inclusive of community health workers, will lead to improvement in adherence to medications and diabetes processes of care, in A1c and LDL-c control, fewer emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and lower overall costs of care; and 3) to fully participate in a collaborative multi-institution network designed to strengthen the research methods for evaluating natural experiments across all sites, and to advance the best analytic methods for natural experiments in the US research community. Our UCLA team will use quasi-experimental designs, de-identified data from UHC, and state-of-the-art modeling strategies to achieve these aims. Our team's 11 years of highly productive partnership with UHC, 19 years of experience evaluating policy-relevant natural experiments, most recently in the NEXT-D study, and 12 years of leading study coordination across national collaboratives, will help ensure our success.

Abstract:	Hypertension and dyslipidemia are undertreated in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D), contributing to the risk of later macrovascular and microvascular diabetes complications. The research focus of this career development award is to improve the management of hypertension and dyslipidemia in these high-risk youth. In specific aim 1, Dr. Katz will conduct focus groups to solicit patient and family perspectives on barriers to and strategies for the effective management of hypertension and dyslipidemia with lifestyle changes or medications. She will also field a national survey to pediatric diabetes care providers to obtain their perceptions of their own barriers to and strategies for the management of hypertension and dyslipidemia in youth with T1D. In specific aim 2, Dr. Katz will use this information to create and pilot a family-focused, modular intervention designed to improve knowledge of and self-efficacy for hypertension and dyslipidemia management in youth with T1D. Michelle Katz, MD, MPH, the primary investigator on this career development award, has a strong background in clinical and health services research, but requires further career development to develop into a successful, independent investigator. Dr. Katz has assembled a multidisciplinary team of nationally recognized leaders in pediatric diabetes, diabetes behavioral research, lipid management in diabetes, epidemiology, and biostatistics to guide her as she conducts all phases of her proposed research. She has described a comprehensive career development plan that will enhance her research background and deepen her methodological expertise to allow her to rigorously accomplish her stated aims. The proposed career development plan utilizes the stimulating, resource-rich environments available through the Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard University. Dr. Katz's research objectives will lead to important knowledge about how to effectively manage hypertension and hyperlipidemia in youth with T1D. By conducting these studies, working closely with her mentors, and completing her educational objectives, Dr. Katz will have the knowledge and the experience to embark on her chosen career as an independent clinical and health services investigator focused on improving health care delivery in pediatric T1D with the goal of reducing future diabetes complications.

Abstract:	For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), successful self-management requires daily self-care behaviors, which can be made easier or more difficult by family members' behaviors. Family members who perform diabetes-specific supportive behaviors (e.g., reminding patients to take medications, exercising with the patient) often also perform behaviors that make adults' self-care more difficult (e.g., sabotaging the patients' self-care attempts or nagging/arguing about self-care). Targeting family members' disease-specific behaviors may be effective for improving patients' adherence. However, few family interventions for adults with T2DM have been successful in improving patients' outcomes, and family interventions are often time-intensive and poorly attended by patients at highest risk of non-adherence (minority groups with low socioeconomic status; SES). It remains unclear whether intervention content can equip adult patients with the necessary skills to identify and manage supportive and obstructive diabetes-specific family behaviors. Furthermore, longitudinal evidence is conspicuously absent; we do not yet know if the relationships between family members' diabetes-specific behaviors and patients' diabetes management (i.e., adherence to self-care behaviors and glycemic control) are unidirectional or reciprocal over time. During this K01 award, the principal investigator (the candidate) will address these gaps in the extant literature while participating in a mentored training experience that will prepare her for success as an independent investigator who identifies sustainable approaches to family interventions that improve the health and well-being of adults with T2DM and their family members in at-risk populations. Specific training goals include developing expertise in family-focused intervention content for adults' diabetes management, behavioral randomized controlled trials (RCTs), delivering intervention content via mobile phone technology, and longitudinal analysis. The proposed plan integrates didactic coursework and training, a mentored research experience (including hands-on experience with an NIDDK R01-funded behavioral RCT), participation in local and national meetings/seminars/workshops/conferences, and active involvement in a robust and extremely supportive research environment. This environment includes NIDDK-funded Center for Diabetes Translational Research and Diabetes Research & Training Center, a NIH Clinical & Translational Science Award, a Center for Health Services Research, a Center for Health Behavior and Health Education, AHRQ-funded programming in patient-centered outcomes research, and the Meharry-Vanderbilt Community Engaged Research Core, which facilitates the active engagement of patients and community clinics in research. In addition, one of the candidate's co-mentors is the director of the multidisciplinary Consortium for Life-span BioBehavioral Family Health Research at the University of Utah, and will provide the candidate with access to associated resources and relevant collaborations. The proposed research includes three specific aims. Aim 1: The candidate will build on findings from her research with the target population (i.e., a racially/ethnically diverse, low SES patient population) to develop family-focused intervention content to equip patients with skills to ask for needed supportive behaviors from family members and to redirect and/or disengage from obstructive family behaviors. Intervention content will be delivered exclusively via basic mobile phone technology (i.e., text messages and voice communications) to enhance reach, participation, and retention. Adult T2DM patients and an adult family member will be recruited for three iterative rounds of usability testing to refine the intervention prior to evaluation. The intervention will be evaluated in a 3-month trial nested within her mentor's larger RCT. Aim 2: The candidate will analyze the extent to which changes in patients' diabetes self-efficacy, self-care behaviors, and glycemic control were occasioned by changes in family members' diabetes-specific behaviors (i.e., the targeted mechanism), and will evaluate the acceptability of delivering intervention content to family members via text messages. Aim 3: Finally, the candidate will analyze the longitudinal relationships between patient-reported diabetes-specific family behaviors and patients' self-care and outcomes, assessed at regular intervals over a 12-month period. This career development plan presents a natural extension of the candidate's research and training to date, and leverages findings from her NIDDK-funded F32 to inform the development of family interventions for adults with T2DM. Upon completion of this plan, the candidate will have expertise in developing and delivering family-focused behavioral intervention in a low SES patient population via technology and in using longitudinal data analysis to evaluate effects of intervention content on health behaviors and outcomes. In combination with findings from the specific aims, this unique expertise will accelerate the candidate's independent research career as an expert in family interventions for adults with T2DM, and will help her reach her ultimate goals of developing and evaluating scalable family interventions to improve health and quality of life for adults with T2DM and their family members.

Abstract:	The burden of diabetes is increasing in epidemic proportions. Blood glucose abnormalities are common among hospitalized patients and are associated with poor clinical and economic outcomes. Despite evidence of effective strategies for inpatient glycemic control and the existence of clinical practice guidelines, inpatient glucose management remains suboptimal, and patients at risk or with unrecognized diabetes are frequently overlooked. The suboptimal recognition and management of diabetes in the hospital appears to be due to various factors beyond knowledge deficits among health care providers. Multiple barriers prevent optimal delivery of care. What predisposes to the persistence of these barriers is not clearly understood and represents a major gap in knowledge that this application will address. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the use of qualitative research methods, including clinical practice observations and interviews of health care providers, will identify what promotes the presence of gaps in diabetes care and will provide cues on how barriers can be corrected. Utilizing the knowledge derived from this innovative approach, coupled with recommendations derived by existing clinical practice guidelines, a novel electronic medical records-driven clinical decision support tool will be developed. Upon detection of a deficiency in the recognition and/or management of a dysglycemic episode, this tool will alert the medical staff and instruct them how to correct it. In aim 2 Dr. Pichardo-Lowden will create this novel tool and test its effectiveness in a pilot study. Based on its effect size, a large clinical trial will be appropriately powered. Aim 3 will consist of a clinical trial that will test the hypothesis that using such electronic medical record clinical decision support tool across intensive and non-intensive care units will reduce the incidence of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, increase detection of patients with or at risk for diabetes, improve documentation of diagnosis and glycemic status, improve inpatient diabetes care practice among providers, and reduce hospital length of stay and readmission rates. This K23 award will allow Dr. Pichardo-Lowden to acquire competency in qualitative research methods, integration of quality improvement strategies in health care, and public health sciences competency which will be essential to become an independent investigator in health care delivery in the area of diabetes. Dr. Pichardo-Lowden's long-term career goal is to study the long-term impact of the implementation of this clinical decision support tool in collaboration with other institutions by conducting a multicenter study and assess the impact of care in the following domains of clinical practice in a larger population: 1. early detection of diabetes, 2. inpatient care of diabetes and dysglycemia, 3. continuity of patient care, 4. modification of clinical practice behaviors among providers' users of the tool, 5. economic impact, and 6. inpatient morbidity and mortality. For this she plans to pursue extramural funding through an R01 or equivalent mechanism.

Abstract:	The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in young children (age <6 years) is rising. Disease management guidelines offered by the ADA and other diabetes care organizations place a high burden of responsibility onto these children's parents and caregivers to check blood sugar, administer insulin, and monitor diet and physical activity to maintain tight glycemic control. Unfortunately, this occurs at a vulnerable time in life when children's behavior is unpredictable, their T1D is difficult to control, parenting stress is elevated, and caregivers are strained by normal child caretaking routines. T1D education and support tends to be highly concentrated at diagnosis/during the inpatient stay, and requires rapid knowledge and skill acquisition on the part of parents. Not all families respond equally well to this teaching model, and many need more guided practice, problem-solving assistance, and behavioral supports than can be offered in a one-size-fits-all patient education approach. Our research will attempt to better meet the needs of individual families through a clinical behavioral stepped-care intervention for T1D in parents of young children by using real-time glycemic control and parental depression indices to intensify management support when indicated. Primary caregivers of young children (<6 years) newly diagnosed with T1D will be randomized to either a 3-step stepped-care (treatment) or usual care (comparison) condition. Stepped-care components include T1D management support delivered by trained lay parent consultants (step 1), T1D parenting strategies and mealtime behavior management delivered by bachelor's level behavioral assistants (step 2), and individualized diabetes education/management planning with a certified diabetes nurse educator and consultation with a diabetes team clinical psychologist (step 3). Biomedical and psychosocial measurements (including A1c, depressive symptoms, mealtime behavior, parenting stress, quality of life) will occur at baseline and 3-month intervals for up to 15 months post-diagnosis. The results of this work will ultimately lead to a more practical approach to T1D education and management that can be translated more easily into a variety of clinical practice settings to support young children's T1D management.

Abstract:	Depression and type 2 diabetes are related pressing public health problems. Depression, antidepressant medications, and the health risk behaviors they are associated with are all risk factors for type 2 diabetes. The overarching goal of this study is to test the additive effects of two proven health interventions--lifestyle modification and medication therapy management--on risk for diabetes in persons with depression and functional impairment. Treatments will be delivered through our model designed for patients with mental illness (MI) whose care is challenged by distance, disability, language, and culture. Cambodian Americans are ideally suited for this research question because, compared to the general population and other Asian Americans, they have 1) high rates of diabetes and disability; 2) high rates of MI; 3) high rates of polypharmacy and medication problems; and 4) a worse profile of the social determinants of health. We will recruit 210 adult Cambodian Americans with major depressive disorder and associated impaired functioning, and who are at high risk for diabetes, from our network of community-based organizations in the northeast. Seventy participants each will be assigned to one of three arms. In the lifestyle arm, community health workers (CHWs) will deliver the lifestyle intervention during weekly-to-triweekly tapered group sessions and 5 individual home visits over 18 months. In the combination arm, in addition to lifestyle, a pharmacist will join the patient and CHW during home visits via telemedicine to deliver medication therapy management, during 5 home visits over 18 months. In the enhanced standard care arm, participants will receive their usual health care enhanced by supportive services. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years. We hypothesize that 1) compared to enhanced standard care, the lifestyle intervention will produce greater improvements in depressive symptoms, medication adherence, objective physical activity, objective sleep quality, and nutrition; and 2) compared to either intervention alone, the combined treatment will improve insulin sensitivity, HbA1c, C-reactive protein, anthropmetrics, blood pressure, lipids, and depressive symptoms. If successful, these approaches may apply to other communities with barriers to care and produce diabetes prevention interventions for patients with MI.

Abstract:	Diabetes affects 8.3% of the US population, and leads to costly adverse health care outcomes. Unfortunately, there may be a quality gap in the care of complex diabetes patients--that is, older patients (age >65 years) and those with comorbid conditions. Current practices, relying primarily on the presence of several factors, are not effective in capturing the risk of poor prognosis, i.e., multiple hospitalization and/or emergency department visits, and death. Hence, little evidence exists so far to help prioritize care for these patients. The diabetes guidelines recognize that tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate for complex patients, and recommend individualizations in tight A1c control. However, neither the outcomes of tight A1c control, nor the effects of the typical treatment regimens used to achieve tight A1c control can be evaluated in clinical trials, with minimal, if any, enrollment of complex diabetes patients due to either their restrictive inclusion criteria or lack of encouragement of the patient and/or clinical investigator to consider the RCT. In order to deliver more effective, efficient, and accountable health care, it is important to help clinicians to examine the relationship between patient complexity and patients' A1c control level, and to modify guidelines appropriately with an evidence base. The proposed research will analyze a cohort of 8,304 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who were cared for by one of the country's 10 largest physician group practices, the University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation, during 2003-2011 to address the following aims: (1) to conduct risk prediction incorporating longitudinal outcomes, (2) to inform guidelines for complex diabetes patients, and (3) to create a patient-centered surveillance tool for detecting short-term negative outcomes. Our analytic approach involves the use of state-of-the-art statistics and machine learning methods to take advantage of the large electronic health records data. The proposed methods and results will help clinicians to identify and quantify risks of tight A1c control in complex diabetes patients and potentially lead to improved patient experiences, and reduce medical expenditures from excess adverse events.

Abstract:	This application for Small Grants for New Investigators to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research (R03) will provide support for Dr. Christina Mangurian, a Latina psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), based at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH). Dr. Mangurian will conduct research to examine diabetes screening and care received by a racially and ethnically diverse, insured population with severe mental illness served within an integrated health care delivery system. Dr. Mangurian has assembled a multidisciplinary team to facilitate her research. She has partnered with the director of the NIDDK-funded Center for Diabetes Translational Research (CDTR), Dr. Julie Schmittdiel, based at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research. Her UCSF co-investigator, Dr. Dean Schillinger, is chief of the UCSF Division of General Internal Medicine at SFGH and has international expertise in diabetes research and health disparities. Their expertise will be complemented by Dr. Eric Vittinghoff, a UCSF biostatistician; Dr. Constance Weisner, a UCSF mental health services researcher; and two NIMH-funded collaborators with expertise in health screening among people with severe mental illness, Drs. Susan Essock and John Newcomer. People with severe mental illnesses (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) die, on average, 25 years earlier than the general population, most often from cardiovascular disease. The antipsychotic medications used to treat this population are one major culprit because they increase the risk of diabetes and other metabolic abnormalities. Unfortunately, almost 10 years after publication of national screening guidelines, 70% of the people receiving these medications remain unscreened for diabetes and pre-diabetes. Small studies suggest minorities with severe mental illness are particularly susceptible to metabolic side effects from the antipsychotic medications, making screening of this high-risk subpopulation particularly important. Unfortunately, examination of this vulnerable population has been challenging because of the fragmentation of the physical and medical health care systems, particularly with respect to the acquisition of laboratory results. There is an urgent need to understand targets for interventions to improve the care of this vulnerable population. Therefore, in aim 1, Dr. Mangurian proposes to determine the diabetes screening rates among a diverse population with severe mental illness who receive services at an integrated care delivery system. In aim 2, she will estimate the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes among diverse populations with severe mental illness. In aim 3, she will determine the proportion of people with co-morbid diabetes and severe mental illness receiving evidence-based diabetes care. The results of this research will identify patient-, provider-, and system-level targets to help guide and design an intervention to close the diabetes screening and care gaps for minorities with severe mental illness in a subsequent R01 application.

Abstract:	Despite substantial evidence that individual- and neighborhood-level "social determinants of health" (SDH) negatively impact diabetes (DM)-related treatment and health outcomes, SDH data are insufficiently captured in most electronic health records (EHRs). Recognizing this, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee recently recommended a set of candidate SDH data domains for inclusion in all EHRs. Our team previously showed that SDH data can feasibly be documented in EHRs; the crucial next step will be to learn how to integrate and present SDH data in EHRs in clinically meaningful ways. Access to actionable information on SDH could give primary care teams a more complete understanding of the factors impacting patients' care and outcomes, and inform clinical decision making, panel management, and referrals to external services. The need for information on SDH is greatest in the health care safety net, whose vulnerable patients have more SDH-related risks, higher DM incidence, and worse DM outcomes than the general US population. Thus, we propose to assess how the IOM-recommended domains can most effectively be incorporated and presented in the EHR to optimize their clinical utility for DM prevention and care, through a cluster-randomized pragmatic trial in 20 CHCs. Using mixed methods, we will identify specific ways to modify existing SDH data documentation tools to more effectively integrate SDH data into DM prevention/care, optimize workflows, and support clinical decision making. We will enhance and adapt the SDH data tools based on these findings, through a user-centered design process, to optimize care teams' use of and acceptance of the tools. We anticipate creating enhanced SDH data tools that prompt specific clinical actions or referrals, augment panel management, and improve referral tracking capabilities, using proven clinical decision support (CDS) approaches. We will implement the adapted tools via a two-arm, randomized, staggered design. We will study integration of the SDH data into workflows, utilization of the data tools, and potential adverse outcomes. We will evaluate the impact of the implemented enhanced tools on DM-related clinical decision making, and on DM prevention, care, and health outcomes (e.g., rates of incident DM; BP, A1c, LDL), in a segmented time-series analysis. This work leverages established partnerships with OCHIN, Inc., the nation's leading developer of EHR tools for CHCs, and other community partners. These partnerships position study results to immediately inform SDH data documentation and use, and to yield lasting care improvements extending beyond DM. Our team includes diverse experts, IOM SDH committee members, and community clinicians. Our timely results will inform practice and policy related to integrating SDH data into clinical workflows in diverse care systems.

Abstract:	The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) and the chronic care model (CCM) are complementary clinical intervention frameworks that are commonly invoked to support better type 2 diabetes (T2DM) outcomes in primary care. Self-management support (SMS) is a core component of both the PCMH and CCM, and focuses on the central role of patients in managing their illness by engaging with and adopting healthy behaviors that promote optimal clinical outcomes. Despite its recognized importance, SMS programs for diabetes continue to demonstrate limited effectiveness in the real world of primary care. SMS is comprised of two complementary and interactive components: (1) patient engagement (e.g., the process of eliciting and responding to patients' emotions and motivations related to health behaviors); and (2) behavioral change tools (e.g., selecting specific goals, creating action plans). While several sophisticated SMS programs have been developed for T2DM, the vast majority are designed with a narrow focus on behavioral change tools, largely ignoring unique aspects of the patient context that drive and maintain health behavior. Considerable clinical research suggests that the addition of a structured, evidence-based program of patient engagement can maximize the effectiveness of SMS programs for patients with T2DM in primary care. To date, however, there has been no systematic study of the degree to which fully integrating enhanced patient engagement as part of SMS will increase the initiation and maintenance of behavior change over time, and for which kinds of patients enhanced patient engagement is essential. To address this gap, we propose to compare a state-of-the-art, evidence-based SMS behavior change tool program, called Connection to Health (CTH), with an enhanced CTH program that includes a practical, time-efficient patient engagement protocol, to create a program with an integrated and comprehensive approach to SMS, which we call "Enhanced Engagement CTH" (EE-CTH). The current study will directly test the added benefit of EE-CTH to CTH with regard to self-management behaviors and glycemic control in resource-limited community health centers, where vast numbers of patients with T2DM from ethnically diverse and medically vulnerable populations receive their care. We will use an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design, employing the RE-AIM framework to test these two SMS programs for T2DM. This will provide critical information that will support dissemination and implementation of effective SMS programs in resource-limited primary care settings, serving diverse and medically vulnerable populations with much to gain from improved SMS.

Abstract:	The overall goal of this project is to improve quality of care of patients with diabetes by identifying patients who may have particular difficulty reaching treatment targets and who could therefore potentially benefit from additional resources. Investigators propose to achieve this goal by developing a technology to accurately identify patients at high risk for not reaching blood glucose targets to enable cost-effective implementation of resource-intensive interventions that improve glycemic control in high-risk individuals. Improving blood glucose control in patients with diabetes could both improve their quality of life by reducing diabetes complications and decrease costs. Some patients that face particularly high barriers to glucose control may benefit from additional resources that are too expensive to apply to broad patient populations. However, it is not currently possible to identify patients at high risk of not being able to reach blood glucose targets with sufficient accuracy to make these interventions cost-effective. One reason for this is that a large fraction of critical information about the patients' functional status, social circumstances and other important factors that may present barriers to glucose control is only found in narrative documents, from which it is difficult to extract. Furthermore, the amount of information about any single patient in the medical record is enormous, and is impossible to process efficiently using standard analytical algorithms such as regression analysis. In the proposed project, investigators will combine two novel technologies--natural language processing of electronic provider notes and artificial intelligence technology Dynamic Logic--to help circumvent these challenges to build a high-accuracy model of risk of not being able to reach blood glucose targets in patients with diabetes. Natural language processing will identify key concepts documented in the provider notes and will help translate their text into a compendium of facts about the patient. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will therefore allow greatly increasing the number of factors/variables that can be considered for the models for prediction of failure to reach glucose control, and ultimately improve their accuracy. Consequently, this translational multidisciplinary project will both advance our understanding of the risk factors for not being able to reach glucose control for patients with diabetes and assist in real-life implementation of interventions that can help lower their blood glucose, decrease the rate of diabetes complications, improve the patients' quality of life, and help control the rising costs of health care.

Abstract:	SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) is an ongoing, large, culturally diverse, multi-center and population-based epidemiological study of youth with diabetes. Initiated in 2000 and encompassing the major racial/ethnic groups in the U.S: non-Hispanic white, African American, Hispanic, Asian-Pacific Islander, and American Indian, SEARCH was designed to estimate the prevalence, incidence, and clinical presentation of diabetes in youth age < 20 years, by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and diabetes type (SEARCH Registry Study). Beginning in 2002, SEARCH recruited a series of incident cohorts representative of the diverse racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic base population, who were well characterized through a variety of surveys, physical, and laboratory assessments soon after diagnosis and followed them longitudinally (SEARCH Cohort Study). This proposal will continue longitudinal follow-up of the participants in the SEARCH Cohort Study to examine four specific aims: 1) to establish, compare, and contrast the burden (prevalence, incidence, progression, and clustering) of acute and chronic complications of diabetes, and explore the responsible risk factors and pathways among youth and young adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes; 2) to explore, compare, and contrast processes of care (including barriers to care and quality of care) and their influence on quality of life among youth with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as they transition from pediatric to adult care; 3) to conduct surveillance of mortality including cause of death in the SEARCH cohort; and 4) to maintain, supplement, and promote access to the SEARCH Cohort repository for biological specimens to conduct scientifically and logistically appropriate ancillary studies. Since there is an earlier onset and increasing rate of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the already high burden of diabetes to the individual and the nation will increase over time. Understanding the factors and pathways that contribute to this burden will provide the foundation to develop strategic interventions to limit individual morbidity and mortality and promote an effective, sustainable national health policy.

Abstract:	Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is common in South Asian women, and many develop lifelong type 2 diabetes (T2DM) soon after delivery. Lifestyle change helps prevent T2DM, but we do not know how to introduce a sustainable service that will change lifestyles of young, busy, and often poor women. We will test a unique intervention embedded within local health systems in 1414 women with GDM from 24 hospitals in South Asia, hoping to show that this intervention will prevent T2DM.

Abstract:	Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) affects 113.9 million people in China. Prevalence has risen dramatically to over 10% and is expected to continue rising. Few Chinese with T2DM are achieving adequate management targets to prevent complications and the current health system infrastructure is struggling to meet these gaps in care. Our project will expand the family health promoter model to develop a scalable model for low-cost, high-quality diabetes care in urban and rural China.

Abstract:	Type 2 diabetes mellitus affects millions of people globally and is a leading cause of kidney disease in adults. Although there are many anti-diabetic medications available to manage high blood sugar in patients, how these medications affect the body is often altered in the context of reduced kidney function. Importantly, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effect of anti-diabetic medications on heart disease and stroke, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease. I propose to study the safety and effectiveness of incretin-based therapy, a new and novel class of anti-diabetic medications, in people with kidney disease. First, I will complete a thorough literature search and summarize the results from previous clinical trials. Second, using a detailed database of health care records for people with diabetes, I will study effectiveness of incretin-based medications in patients with chronic kidney disease in reducing the incidence of death and heart disease. The database contains detailed health care records on prescription drug use, diagnoses, laboratory tests, hospitalizations, and death. The information in the database will allow us to assess the occurrence of heart disease and stroke for people with chronic kidney disease using incretin-based medications compared to those using other common anti-diabetic medications. Knowledge gained from this study will inform clinicians, policymakers, and patients when making treatment decisions about the management of type 2 diabetes in those with chronic kidney disease.

Abstract:	Using community-based participatory action and Indigenous methodologies, this Indigenous-led study will identify multilevel and scalable interventions and effective Western diabetes/obesity services (prevention, treatment, and self-management) and interventions into which local Traditional health practices can be integrated to improve Aboriginal health across the generations. An implementation research team (IRT) will collaborate with local First Nations Friendship Center/Society organizations in two urban (Kelowna and Vernon) and two rural off-reserve (Lillooet and Williams Lake) Aboriginal settings in the interior of British Columbia. These communities are located in the west and central regions of the Interior Health Authority and make up 83.9% of the total number of Aboriginal people living in BC Interior health region. Four advisory teams, made up of community members, leaders, health providers, Elders/traditional healers, researchers, FNFC staff, and others will guide and be involved in all aspects of the study to ensure activities are culturally relevant and respectful of protocols, traditions, and knowledge, and benefit the community. In building respectful relationships, a variety of perspectives will inform best practices in Traditional/Western integration implementation or scale-up. Following community research agreements/university/health authority ethics approvals, Talking circles, community forums, environmental scans, literature review, and surveys will be used to explore and prioritize promising practices and cost-effective interventions. The research and advisory teams will work with Canadian Institutes of Health Research Partners for Engagement and Knowledge Exchange, First Nations Health Authority, and local groups to increase the profile of health priorities for diabetes/obesity health services in these communities and move forward with future funding applications and implementation.

Abstract:	Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common and significant risk factor for future type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the mother and offspring. Migration to a new country poses unique challenges in managing one's health as is the case in immigrant women with GDM diagnoses, low postpartum diabetes screening, and increased risk of developing T2DM. Low postpartum diabetes screening signals a significant knowledge-to-care gap for immigrant women with pGDM. There is an urgent need to better understand the health care requirements of this high-risk population in order to identify strategies to effectively translate essential knowledge regarding diabetes prevention. Traditional and novel qualitative research will aid in the recognition of patient-identified challenges to self-care, as well as barriers and facilitators of healthy behavior change. This study aims to 1) identify original research strategies promoting health education in immigrants at risk for diabetes, 2) conduct a qualitative inquiry using focus groups of East African women with pGDM to determine challenges to self-care and healthy behavior change, and 3) use Digital Storytelling to document the experiences of women with diabetes to provide novel and powerful narratives. Through documentation using multimedia elements, the experiences of immigrant women diagnosed with GDM will allow researchers and healthcare providers to learn from personal narratives by patients and develop culturally appropriate and targeted interventions.

Abstract:	First Nation (FN) seniors are at high risk for diabetes morbidity/mortality and this is compounded by suboptimal care in isolated FN communities. Limited community nursing capacity and a lack of electronic registries/records leads to a reactive, disorganized approach to care. This situation is directly responsible for the poor diabetes-related outcomes observed in FN seniors. Health Canada's 2010-2015 Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative calls for innovative, culturally relevant approaches aimed at increasing community wellness and reducing the burden of diabetes through the use of local knowledge. The Canadian Diabetes Association specifically mentions the importance of using systems to identify diabetics and have a systematic follow-up process. The RADAR study fits exactly with these priorities by using health technology information systems and a centralized care coordinator to strengthen FN community capacity. RADAR will establish system-wide, scalable infrastructure (an integrated diabetes registry/records system) that will support front-line community nurses in transforming care for FN seniors with diabetes. The proposed model has two major components to improve the care of FN senior diabetics: 1) implementation of a common diabetes registry and health records system (eHIPP technology); and 2) a care coordinator to support front-line providers for measurement, monitoring, and streamlined, coordinated referral and follow-up with use of the technology. We hypothesize that the RADAR model will result in an overall improvement in the quality of clinical care of FN seniors living with diabetes on reserve. We also hypothesize that the RADAR model will be effective, efficient, and transferable at the organizational level within these communities and will have a broader public health impact on the population of those with diabetes. Importantly, all outcomes will be assessed from the lens of the FN communities to ensure the model is culturally appropriate from their perspective.

Abstract:	Individuals with diabetes fear suffering from blindness, limb amputations, kidney and heart failure, and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). These complications are influenced by genetic risk, lifestyle, sex/gender, socioeconomic and cultural (e.g., Indigenous) status, geography (rural), and co-morbid disease (e.g., arthritis). Patients and non-researcher health professionals have joined our SPOR Network to redefine methods for earliest diagnosis and treatments that will transform the health outcomes for all with diabetes. With primary care and specialist health networks across Canada, we will establish a national diabetes patient registry to evaluate best methods for screening of complications and relevant health determinants. We will design a smart-phone app, Risk Calculator, to aid patients and health care providers in their shared decision making about care paths customized to address unique risk. By linking clinical information with other biological factors (genetics, medical imaging of affected organs), we will identify why some individuals have higher risk than others for complications. This knowledge will guide our development of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to be applied before clinical signs of complications appear. To achieve best glucose control and prevent hypoglycemia, we will develop and test innovative external artificial pancreas therapies in conjunction with smartphone apps to monitor glucose control, physical activity, and other modulators. We will evaluate novel diagnostic tests and therapies discovered by our scientists for diabetic heart, kidney, eye, and nerve disease, along with user-friendly web-based tools to assess lifestyle (diet, physical activity) and effectiveness of personalized behaviour-modifying interventions. By aligning biomedical, clinical, population health, health services research, and education with what matters most to patients, we will bridge the knowledge translation gap with real impact on chronic disease outcomes.

Abstract:	Attaining and maintaining healthy weight is a major public health goal for preventing diabetes. While intensive lifestyle interventions are successful in weight loss and reducing risk of diabetes, low socioeconomic status (SES) populations, which have a higher burden of obesity, are difficult to reach with health system or population-based weight loss interventions. The workplace offers a potentially effective setting for health promotion programs aimed at low SES populations. The proposed study team brings together nationally recognized research teams with complementary expertise in community-based obesity prevention and in workplace health and safety interventions to test a workplace intervention program targeted at low SES workers. Working in partnership with BJC HealthCare, a large health care employer with many low-wage workers, this project will evaluate modifiable work environment and individual-level barriers and facilitators of healthy eating and activity (aim 1). Guided by this formative work, the study team will adapt existing group- and individual-level intervention models to promote healthy weight among workers. We will develop and test an innovative multi-level intervention that includes an interactive obesity treatment program (iOTA) using SMS text messaging (aim 2B). This innovative mHealth intervention is embedded in a newly described Healthy Workplace Participatory Program, which incorporates employee participation in decision making to produce changes in the workplace environment that are acceptable, effective, and sustainable (aim 2A). These nested interventions will be tested in a large delayed-start group-randomized trial. This study will rigorously test readily scalable interventions that can be translated to other work settings to reduce obesity and diabetes risk among low SES workers, a group at high risk for these disorders. This pragmatic clinical trial will advance the long- term goal of enabling employers and employees to reduce obesity and obesity-associated illnesses, including diabetes.

Abstract:	Anticipated impacts on veterans' healthcare: While amputation rates for veterans with diabetes have been reduced with system and provider intervention, they continue to be high. Amputation is a devastating complication that is preceded in > 80% of cases by a diabetic foot ulcer. This study applies advanced behavioral theories to intervene to improve care for veterans at risk for amputation combined with dermal thermometry. If this promising theory-driven approach can work in a clinical setting where improvements in foot care are urgently needed for these vulnerable veterans with a previous ulcer, it will be an important scientific contribution that could lower the risk of recurrent ulcers and amputation in veterans with diabetes. Project background: Veterans with diabetes who have had a previous ulcer are at highest risk for new ulcers and amputation, particularly if they have neuropathy or vascular disease and have poor foot self-care or non-adherence to diet, medication, and exercise recommendations. It is difficult to activate at-risk patients to improve self-care and detect foot abnormalities or inflammation at an early stage, particularly when they have other risks to manage. Interventions targeting mediators of amputation risk (ulcer recurrence) promise to lower risk and improve outcomes in these high-risk veterans. Dermal thermometry effectively allows for early identification of inflammation and is a warning sign to contact a healthcare professional. Interventions are more effective when they are behaviorally tailored and combine multiple behavioral theories. This study will evaluate a comprehensive risk-stratified personalized tailored intervention aimed to improve self-care and reduce ulcer recurrence in veterans with diabetes and prior diabetic foot ulcer. Project objectives: Proposed is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of a comprehensive tailored intervention (TI) aimed to improve self-care and self-monitoring (including dermal thermometry) through behavioral counseling. The primary specific aim is to evaluate if TI reduces the proportion of recurrent ulcers at 18 months compared to the current practice (CP) group. The secondary specific aims are to evaluate the impact of TI on foot care skills, quality of life (QOL), peak plantar pressure, and step count, compared to CP at 18 months. Exploratory aims will be to examine the impact of TI on amputation, gait temporal-spatial parameters, C-reactive protein, glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c), and depression at 18 months, compared to CP. Project methods: We will recruit adults with diabetes who have had a previously healed foot ulcer. Using a blinded RCT, we will test the effect of TI in relation to CP. Participants in TI will receive a comprehensive intervention, including telephone counseling and tailored mailings from health counselors. The TI is an integrated, personalized intervention targeting foot self-care and self-monitoring that includes dermal thermometry as well as diet, exercise, and medication-taking, incorporating the transtheoretical model and prospect theory and delivered using motivational interviewing principles. The intervention will be standardized and fidelity of the intervention will be maintained. Participants randomized to CP will receive enhancements--current VA best practices for improving foot risk, as well as telephone counseling and mailings from health counselors providing education about health prevention strategies not related to diabetes or foot care. Key outcomes are ulceration, QOL, plantar pressure, physical activity, and foot care skills. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, and 6, 12 and 18 months. All analyses will be intent-to-treat.

Abstract:	Asian Indians have high rates of diabetes, prediabetes, and cardiometabolic risk factors. There is strong evidence that lifestyle change, particularly weight loss, increasing physical activity, and improving diet quality can prevent or delay diabetes, reduce cardiometabolic risk factors such as elevated glucose, plasma lipids, and blood pressure, and improve outcomes among individuals with diabetes. Implementing lifestyle change education and support at the worksite may be an effective and cost-effective method to deliver prevention in a way that is acceptable, accessible, and sustainable, and overcomes barriers to lifestyle change (e.g., lack of time or resources). Building off previous work by the international study team, this study proposes implementing and evaluating in a pre-post design trial the acceptability, delivery, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of a worksite-based lifestyle improvement package, including a peer-led lifestyle change education program augmented with changes in the worksite environment that promote social support, healthy eating, and exercise. The lifestyle education program will include 2000 adults with prediabetes (HbA1c of 5.7-6.4%) or unmedicated diabetes (HbA1c=6.5% identified at screening) across eight diverse worksites in India (changes to the worksite environment will impact a much broader population of employees). A mixed-methods approach will be used to evaluate implementation of the program. The study aims to measure (1) success of implementation in terms of program adoption (participation and changes in weight and diet and physical activity behaviors among lifestyle class participants); fidelity to the program (activities of study-affiliated worksite staff, changes to the food options at the worksite canteen, management support for the program, and changes in the worksite environment); and program acceptability as reported by employees, managers, supervisors, and lifestyle education program participants and dropouts during in-depth, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions; (2) program effectiveness by evaluating the number of cardiometabolic risk goals reached for reductions in blood pressure, triglycerides, and HbA1c (the primary outcome) and through changes in secondary outcomes including rates of diabetes incidence and regression to normoglycemia and changes in anthropometry, lipids, and fasting glucose; and (3) value and return on the investment of the program for employers by assessing program costs, cost-effectiveness, and changes in staff productivity, absenteeism, health status, and quality of life. This project will deliver scientific innovations (lifestyle education programs with text message supports during maintenance) with social innovations (educated peer health educators delivering a program to a large at-risk population) and business innovation (worksite stakeholder commitment and partnering researchers to help deliver the program with fidelity, improve the workplace health environment, and evaluate the model). If the program is shown to be feasible, acceptable, effective, and cost-effective at these worksites, the program could be disseminated to other worksites throughout India and elsewhere.

Abstract:	The current proposed research will focus on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its complications among adults with diabetes in Northern Mexico. One major component of the study will assess the effectiveness of an adapted evidence-based community health worker intervention, Meta Salud Diabetes, at reducing behavioral and clinical risk for cardiovascular disease among adults with diabetes in Sonora, Mexico. We will conduct a cluster randomized trial among adult patients with diabetes sampled from 20 Secretaria de Salud (Secretary of Health)-operated health centers in Sonora. Existing community health workers at each of ten health centers randomized to the intervention condition will be trained in the adapted CVD prevention curriculum. The community health workers will then enroll 20 participants with diabetes at each site into the 12-week intervention. Psychosocial (e.g., knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs) and behavioral (e.g., smoking, healthy eating) risk factors for cardiovascular disease will be assessed via self-administered surveys during the first of the 12 weekly educational sessions. Clinical risk factors (i.e., BMI, blood pressure, lipids, blood sugar) will be abstracted from existing patient records at the health centers. We will then assess changes that occur at three months (immediately after the 12-week intervention) and 12 months. Changes in the intervention clinic will be compared to changes over the same time period among adult patients with diabetes in each of ten health centers randomized to the control condition (i.e., the usual standard of care). We define the intervention effect as changes over time that occur among intervention participants net of changes over time among diabetic patients at control health centers. We further propose a second component of the study that will consist of systematic engagement of local, state, and national decision makers essential to scale up and sustain the intervention into the standard package of services offered by government-run health centers in Sonora and other Mexican states. These government-run health centers, like those where our cluster randomized trials are executed, represent an ideal system for scale-up of Meta Salud Diabetes and other evidence-based community health worker interventions, since most Mexicans are eligible and receive care at these health centers and because Mexico's centralized health care system will greatly facilitate system-wide integration. Extensive qualitative and descriptive data will be collected on the facilitators and barriers to adopt and integrate community health worker chronic disease interventions throughout Sonoran health centers and other health care systems serving high-risk populations in Mexico.

Abstract:	The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in the US is disproportionately high among minority women. In order to participate as partners in health care, DM patients need self-management education and support. Diabetes self-management (DSM) support is effective in helping DM patients make good choices and achieve clinical goals but is difficult to deliver in medical practice settings. Virtual reality technology can assist DM patients and their clinical teams with DSM support by providing effective educational tools in an engaging, learner-centered context that fosters self-efficacy and skill proficiency. Our prior work demonstrated that virtual worlds, like Second Life (SL), are suitable for supporting DSM education for patients. SL, an Internet-based virtual world, is an example of an immersive, three-dimensional environment which supports social networking and interaction with information. We now aim to enhance our curriculum using a medical group visit design to study whether the Women in Control virtual world group medical visit leads to similarly effective health and educational outcomes compared to face-to-face group medical visits. Our aims are to conduct a randomized, controlled trial of the comparative effectiveness of a virtual world DSM group medical visit format vs. a face-to-face DSM group visit format to increase physical activity and improve glucose control among black/African American and Hispanic women with uncontrolled DM at six-month follow-up, and to conduct a qualitative, ethnographic study of participant engagement with the virtual world platform during the virtual world group sessions, between group sessions, and following completion of the eight-week curriculum to characterize learners' self-directed interactions with the technology platform and assess the correlation of these interactions with DSM behaviors and diabetes control.

Abstract:	Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent and devastating chronic disease, affecting >29 million people in the United States (US). Health insurance and continued access to health care services are essential for optimal DM care and management; therefore, it is hypothesized that Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions could substantially improve access to health insurance and health care services for patients at risk for DM or already diagnosed with DM ("with DM risk or DM"). The ACA called for every state to significantly expand Medicaid coverage by 2014; little is yet known about the impact of ACA Medicaid expansion on the prevention, treatment, expenditures, and outcomes of patients with DM risk or DM. In a 2012 legal challenge, the US Supreme Court ruled that states were not required to implement ACA Medicaid expansions; thus (by January 1, 2015), 28 states and the District of Columbia expanded Medicaid, while 22 states did not. This "natural experiment" presents a unique opportunity to learn whether and to what extent Medicaid expansion can affect health care access and services for patients with DM risk or DM. We will use this unprecedented natural experiment to expand our understanding of how Medicaid expansion impacts DM prevention, treatment, expenditures, and health outcomes. We will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network (Accelerating Data Value Across a National Community Health Center Network), which has data from 718 community health centers (CHCs), including 470 CHCs in 12 Medicaid expansion states and 248 CHCs in 9 non-expansion states. From this dataset, we will collect detailed information on changes in health insurance, service receipt, and health outcomes, with data spanning 9 years (pre- and post-expansion), comparing states that expanded Medicaid, and those that did not. Moreover, building on our prior work, we will link EHR data from 213 Oregon ADVANCE CHCs to Oregon Medicaid claims data to assess Medicaid expenditures among patients with DM risk or DM. The specific aims are as follows: (aim 1) compare pre-post insurance status, overall visits, and chronic disease management visits among patients with DM risk or DM, in expansion versus non-expansion states; (aim 2) compare pre-post receipt of primary and secondary DM preventive services (e.g., screening for obesity, lipid levels, glycosylated hemoglobin) among patients with DM risk or DM, in expansion versus non-expansion states; (aim 3) compare pre-post changes in DM-related biomarkers (e.g., body mass index, blood pressure, lipid levels) in patients with DM risk or DM among newly insured (gained Medicaid in post-period), already insured (had Medicaid coverage in pre- and post-period), and continuously uninsured (pre- and post-period) patients in states that expanded Medicaid; and (aim 4) measure pre-post changes in Oregon Medicaid expenditures among newly insured compared to already insured patients with DM risk or DM. Findings will be relevant to policy and practice, informing further improvements in the US health care system to ensure access for vulnerable populations and mitigate disparities in DM prevention, treatment, and health outcomes.

Abstract:	Background: Peer support among patients with diabetes has been found to be an effective intervention to address barriers to diabetes self-management; however, one potential limitation of peer support programs is that peer supporters by definition lack substantial medical and other content knowledge. To increase the potential impact of peer support programs, a key next step is to test whether providing peer supporters with evidence-based educational tools enhances the effectiveness of such programs. We thus developed a personally tailored, interactive diabetes medication and self-management e-health decision aid (iDecide). In a prior study, we found that low-income, urban Latino and African American adults with diabetes who worked with community health workers (CHWs) using iDecide had greater improvements with satisfaction and decreased diabetes distress. Since many health care systems in low-resource settings do not have trained CHWs or other outreach workers, it is important to investigate whether programs such as iDecide are helpful in assisting peer coaches. Accordingly, in the current study we conducted a trial in a low-resource health care system (Detroit VA Medical Center) testing the effectiveness of a peer coach-delivered iDecide intervention for patients with poor glycemic control. Objectives: The three main objectives of this randomized controlled trial were to 1) test the effectiveness of a technology-enhanced peer coaching program (iDecide arm) in improving glucose control relative to peer coaching without technology enhancement (Peer Support-Alone arm); 2) assess the impact of the intervention on key patient-centered outcomes, including patients' satisfaction and involvement with care, perceived social support, diabetes-specific quality of life, and medication adherence; and 3) identify patient characteristics associated with engagement in the intervention and mediators and moderators of the intervention's impact on patient outcomes. Methods: From September 2014 to September 2016, veterans with A1c > 8.0% were enrolled in a 6-month peer coaching intervention. Participants were randomized to either the iDecide arm or Peer Support-Alone arm, both consisting of an initial face-to-face coaching session followed by weekly phone calls to discuss behavioral goals. Veterans who had poor glycemic control in the past (A1c > 8.0%) but whose most recent A1c in the prior 6 months was < 8.0% were recruited as peer coaches. For peer coaches in both arms, we held a 2-hour initial training session that focused on key motivational interviewing-based communication skills and helping participants define a longer-term behavioral goal and specific short-term steps to reach that goal ("action planning"). Peer coaches in the iDecide arm participated in an additional 1-hour training session on how to navigate the iDecide tool that was delivered on iPads. The iDecide program consisted of four main sections: 1) information and illustrative animations on how diabetes affects how glucose is processed in the body and how different medication classes, foods, and physical activity act to affect blood sugar; 2) participants viewed their own risk of diabetes complications (tailored based upon their baseline A1c) and could interactively change their A1c levels and see in pictographs how this changed their risk of different complications; 3) participants reviewed their current diabetes medications and barriers to taking medications that they had identified on the baseline survey and engaged with an interactive "issue card" to help elicit their preferences and priorities in terms of different medication characteristics; and 4) participants were prompted to set goals, develop a specific action plan to address identified barriers or other concerns, and generate specific questions and concerns to discuss with their doctor. Participants were given the link to the iDecide program with their personal information for them to access at their convenience throughout the intervention period and encouraged to continue to access the program as needed. Findings: Of the 260 veterans enrolled, 255 participants (88%) completed 6-month assessments and 237 (82%) completed 12-month assessments. Ninety-eight percent were men, and 63% were African American. In the Peer Support-Alone group, mean baseline A1cs of 9.07% improved to 8.39% (-0.68%, p<0.001) at 6 months and remained 8.55% (-0.54, p=0.004) at 12 months. Mean baseline A1c in the iDecide group was 9.08% at baseline and improved to 8.38% (-0.70, p<0.001) at 6 months and remained 8.52% (-0.55, p=0.002) at 12 months. There were no significant between-group differences at 6-month or 12-month follow-up. There were no significant changes in systolic blood pressure at any time point in either group. Significant within-group improvements were observed in self-reported diabetes-specific social support in both groups between baseline and 6 months and between baseline and 12 months. Conclusion: Clinical gains achieved through a volunteer peer coach program were not increased by the addition of a tailored e-Health educational tool. Impact: This study is among the first efforts to respond to the call for the testing of e-health consumer health applications for use by nontraditional caregivers such as volunteer peer coaches with racial and ethnic minority and low-literate populations. Our study found that both peer support models were effective in improving A1c levels right after the interventions, and importantly, these gains were sustained 6 months after the programs' conclusion. The A1c improvements of >0.5% achieved at both 6 and 12 months in both intervention arms in this study are both statistically and clinically significant. A mean difference in A1c level of 0.5% translates into an absolute 2.8% risk reduction in diabetes events over 10 years. Of note, these clinically significant and sustained gains were not further improved through use of an e-health educational tool in the initial face-to-face visit and its availability to participants throughout the intervention period. This suggests that the ongoing supportive relationships between peer coaches and their assigned patients in both peer support arms were the most important active ingredient in the intervention's success. This is good news for resource-constrained health systems that may lack the capacity to develop, continually update, and manage tailored e-health programs. Volunteer peer support programs can be important complements to over-burdened formal health care providers to improve the frequency and intensity of ongoing support between face-to-face clinic visits. Unlike most other tested diabetes management support programs, gains achieved over the 6-month intervention period were sustained 6 months after the end of the program. Moreover, such programs that mobilize patients to help other patients could realistically be provided over sustained periods of time.

Abstract:	Obesity and diabetes are serious health problems in the United States, with rapidly increasing prevalence and incidence over the last 10 years. National data document alarming increases in overweight and obesity, and among Latinos the prevalence is 78%, markedly higher than in the general population. An estimated 25.6 million people 20 years or older have diabetes in the U.S., with the greatest increases in prevalence among racial and ethnic minority populations, further complicated by disparities in socioeconomic status. Hispanics face a diabetes prevalence twice that of non-Hispanic whites and suffer higher rates of diabetes complications and mortality. Nationally, it is estimated that there are over 2.6 million hired farm workers in the U.S., and California is among the largest employers of these workers. In California, over 450,000 people are employed in agriculture, with more than two-thirds being of Latino ethnicity. Most are immigrants with low levels of education and many have Spanish as their only language. This population also faces issues with limited access to health care, compounded by poverty and low socioeconomic status. While intervention efforts have demonstrated that an intensive lifestyle approach promoting diet and physical activity can significantly reduce obesity and diabetes incidence, there continues to be a need for effective programs designed for underserved and immigrant populations--a sizeable proportion of the U.S. working population. The overall goal of this study is to validate the effectiveness of an obesity and diabetes intervention among low-literate immigrant farm workers. We propose that a lifestyle intervention delivered at the agricultural worksite will improve obesity and diabetes risk for employees and will prove to be cost-effective for the employer. The collaboration of established investigators at UC Davis with Reiter Affiliated Companies (RAC, a large berry grower in California) and the Health Initiative of the Americas at UC Berkeley (experts in organizing health campaigns for underserved immigrant populations) creates a unique opportunity to achieve significant positive health outcomes through a total worker health approach. Our efforts will build upon two successful pilot studies conducted with RAC and will enable us to reach a larger number of people and evaluate the program's translation and sustainability potential. Successful achievement of the project goals will enable dissemination of the program to improve the health of workers via a cost-effective and culturally tailored obesity and diabetes risk factor intervention.

Abstract:	Diabetes is a complex, multi-factorial condition, affecting 26 million people in the United States and an additional 79 million people are at high risk of developing diabetes. However, 90% of people at high risk of diabetes don't know about their risk and very few are given guidance by their health care providers about improving their diets, engaging in physical activity, and lowering weight to reduce their risk of getting diabetes. We also know very little about how much these behavior choices are influenced by one's social connections, particularly partners or spouses that live in the same household, share resources, and have the same values and access to similar information. For example, emergence of diseases like cancers or diabetes can heighten family members' concerns of also developing disease, and stimulate them to engage in preventive behaviors. We aim to investigate these social "spillover" effects on preventive behaviors and diabetes risk within households by analyzing longitudinal data from 2005 to 2014 from a large, diverse insured population. Kaiser Permanente Northern California has a longitudinal and multi-ethnic database of 3.3 million members and offers a rich opportunity to link biometric, laboratory, and health service utilization data for primary plan members and their linked dependents. We will study whether a new diabetes diagnosis in the household prompts partners or spouses to change their lifestyle behaviors; whether this adoption of preventive behaviors is different across demographic or socioeconomic groups; and whether these behaviors are maintained 3-6 years after the diagnosis. We will also study whether adult family members that are on the same health insurance plan and live in the same household of someone that was newly diagnosed with diabetes in this time have a high risk of getting diabetes themselves. And lastly, we will study whether the lifestyle behavior changes adopted are associated with reduced risk of diabetes in the family member. The findings from this study may lead to new ways of identifying people at high risk of diabetes--for example, doctors notifying people with new diabetes diagnoses to encourage their household members to get checked too. In addition, it may also lead to new studies to help whole families change and maintain their lifestyle behaviors together. Our proposal aims to use a unique and underutilized set of databases to answer these topical and innovative questions. Utilizing the combined and interdisciplinary expertise of our Emory University and KPNC study team, we will use advanced statistical and quasi-experimental methods to analyze the data, controlling for measurable biases and using sensitivity analyses to explore factors that cannot be accounted for. This study is novel in concept, efficient in design, and findings will have important implications for screening recommendations, for advising people with a new diagnosis of diabetes, and for exploring avenues to stimulate sustainable healthful behaviors through families.

Abstract:	Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) has been associated with increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia in the elderly. Even minor cognitive impairments dramatically affect disease self-management. This, in turn, is associated with poor glycemic and blood pressure control in diabetes, which by themselves increase the risk of dementia, provoking a reinforcing cycle of disease. It is imperative to find interventions to delay or prevent cognitive compromise in diabetic patients. This is especially true in the VA, in view of the high incidence of both diabetes and dementia in our growing population of elderly veterans. This study will provide the first evaluation of the effects of computerized cognitive training (CCT) on DM self-management behavior and clinical outcomes, in addition to cognition. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to (a) determine whether the CCT, relative to an active control, improves cognition (memory, executive functions, attention), DM-related behavior (DM self-management and medication adherence), and clinical outcomes (glycemic and blood pressure control), 6 and 12 months after the intervention; (b) demonstrate efficacy by improvement in behavioral outcomes 6 months after the intervention; (c) document the effects of CCT on the successive changes in cognition, DM related-behavior, and glycemic and blood pressure control; and (d) explore the impact of demographic and health characteristics, on the intervention effects. Methods: A total of 300 non-demented DM elderly, 65 and older, with internet access and without major visual or auditory impairment, will be enrolled from the James J. Peters and Ann Arbor VAMCs. Participants will be randomized to CCT or games intervention and perform the program every other day for 24 total sessions. The proposed CCT program, Personal Coach from Cognifit, is designed to improve cognition of elderly persons by targeting their weak cognitive functions. The games intervention, produced by the same company, includes sessions identical to the first two and last two of the CCT program. Four months after the intervention, subjects will receive a one-week booster training. Subjects will be assessed at baseline; and immediately, 6 months, and 12 months after the intervention. At each time point, cognitive function, DM self-management, and blood pressure will be assessed; blood will be drawn for HbA1c measurement. Longitudinal mixed-model analyses will assess the effects of the intervention on change in outcomes over time. Path analyses will evaluate the inter-relationships among changes in cognition, DM self-management, and clinical outcomes for each intervention at 6 and 12 months. Findings: Data analysis is anticipated to begin in the third year. Impact: The increasing population of older diabetic elderly veterans makes treatment and prevention of cognitive compromise an important goal for the Department of Veterans Affairs. As the number of veterans with cognitive impairment increases, so will the overall cost of care for the VA. Further, the deleterious impact of dementia on the health and quality of life of veterans is massive. The findings of the study will be applicable to prevention of cognitive decline and dementia among elderly veterans with diabetes, by providing a basis for the use of CCT in therapeutic efforts to minimize diabetes-related complications. Further, this study will focus on medication adherence and diabetes self-management. The study will also elucidate characteristics facilitating the effects of CCT on diabetes-related behavioral and clinical outcomes. Identifying such characteristics will likely lead to better targeted implementation of CCT as a service for veterans at highest risk for cognitive compromise.

Abstract:	Background: Veterans bear a disproportionate burden of diagnosed diabetes at a 24% prevalence compared to 8.3% nationally. Patient-level factors account for >95% of patient care and health management. Poor patient knowledge/information and participation are two key factors responsible for the most prevalent disparities in the VA health care system for which patient activation and adherence interventions may help to reduce disparities in care, but patients have a low rate of engagement in self-care behaviors. Health care systems have established personal health records (PHRs), such as My HealtheVet (MHV), that enable patients to access their own health records, obtain health information, and communicate with providers about their disease conditions. This study proposes to activate patients and improve patient diabetes-related behaviors through development of an adapted brief MHV-driven patient activation and self-care intervention that enhances diabetes self-management (DSM) skills (e.g., physical activity, diet, medication adherence, and self-monitoring) in high-risk, rural veterans. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to a) adapt a brief My HealtheVet (MHV) intervention to enhance its appropriateness for veterans with diabetes and increase patient activation and DSM skills; b) test feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of the adapted brief MHV intervention on DSM skills in rural veterans; and c) evaluate veterans' experience with the adapted brief MHV intervention and identify perceived barriers, facilitators, and enablers of its use, and assess the potential for wider dissemination. Methods: To achieve these objectives, we will develop an adapted brief MHV intervention that targets DSM skills. Training for features of My HealtheVet (setting goals, entering/tracking data, researching health-related information, secure messaging) will first be developed. We will obtain a nonrandomized sample of at least 20 rural veterans, age 45+ years, with diabetes and either hypertension or hyperlipidemia from community-based outpatient clinics in the Charleston VA catchment area. The intervention will involve an initial in-person session with the rest of the intervention sessions delivered remotely. In addition, weekly reminders (or booster messages) will be sent to each participant through the MHV secure messaging. All participants will undergo assessments at baseline and at 6 weeks follow-up. For those who agree, semi-structured telephone interviews will be conducted with study participants to evaluate veterans' experience with learning and navigating MHV through the intervention and to assess feasibility, ease of use, and refinement for potential dissemination to a broader audience. The primary outcome (frequency of and satisfaction with MHV use) and secondary outcomes (change in DSM skills and clinical indicators) will be assessed in all participants at 6 weeks follow-up. The primary analysis will involve mixed-effects models. Findings: N/A. Impact: The proposed project offers a potential solution to strengthening veterans' self-management of chronic disease conditions through intervention of an easily accessible self-management tool, the VA's PHR--My HealtheVet--that fosters the knowledge and skill-building aspects of diabetes self-management. The proposed approach creates flexible and accessible strategies for increasing knowledge, developing self-monitoring skills, building self-efficacy, and enhancing patient empowerment. Thus, active orientation to the use of MHV as a skill-building tool will foster adoption of proper self-monitoring behaviors. The proposed project serves to yield a more patient-oriented process in access to and quality of care, and disease management. Furthermore, this project will provide early evidence to increase adoption and use of MHV in disadvantaged veteran groups.

Abstract:	Background: SMAs involve groups of patients who share a common chronic condition and meet over time to receive education, self-management enhancement, and medication management to improve clinical outcomes. A systematic review by VA found that SMAs modestly improve glycemia in patients with diabetes. Although these SMA programs sometimes included diet and physical activity counseling, weight management was not a primary goal, and weight typically was not reduced. Instead, medication intensification was the primary strategy for improving glycemia, and this strategy can lead to weight gain. For overweight patients with diabetes, weight loss is first-line therapy because it can improve glycemic control and because excess weight leads to poorer outcomes. Moreover, many antiglycemic medications cause weight gain and hypoglycemic events, which may counteract the potential macrovascular benefits of glycemic control. Dietary interventions, however, can lower weight and improve glycemic control while reducing antiglycemic medication needs and, therefore, subsequent risk for hypoglycemic episodes. In our prior research, we induced weight loss and improved glycemic control while decreasing antiglycemic medications. A combination of an intensive weight management program with the diabetes management offered in SMAs has potential to further improve diabetes outcomes, reduce complications, decrease costs, and increase health-related quality of life. Such a combined intervention is ideal for patients with diabetes because of their unique dietary considerations, and their need for careful glycemic and medication management during weight loss. Objectives: We will examine whether an intensive, group-based weight management program followed by an SMA intervention (WM/SMA arm) is comparably effective (non-inferior) to the SMA intervention alone for improving glycemic control while using less antiglycemic medication and resulting in fewer hypoglycemic events and lower health care costs. Methods: A total of 263 overweight VA outpatients with uncontrolled (hemoglobin A1c > = 8.0%) type 2 diabetes participated in this RCT. Similar to prior SMAs, the SMA visits occurred every 4 weeks for 16 weeks and then every 8 weeks for 32 weeks for a total of 9 visits. Sessions were led by a physician and trained interventionists, and included educational topics related to diabetes management (including diet and physical activity), self-management training, and medication adjustment. Similar to our prior weight management trials, the WM/SMA group met every 2 weeks for 16 weeks and then every 8 weeks for 32 weeks, for a total of 13 visits. The weight management program focused on a low carbohydrate dietary pattern because of its potential to lower glycemia, leading to reduced antiglycemic medication needs. After 16 weeks, meeting content shifted to the SMA intervention content but weight management continued to be addressed at the meetings. The primary outcome was glycemic control assessed by hemoglobin A1c measured at baseline and at 16, 32, and 48 weeks. Secondary outcomes included hypoglycemic events, changes in the antiglycemic medication regimen as assessed by a summary score, and weight and health care costs. Diabetes-specific health-related quality of life and medication adherence were also examined. Findings: Initial findings were that both the WM/SMA and SMA interventions improved participants' HbA1c. The WM/SMA intervention had a greater initial improvement in HbA1c at weeks 16 and 32 but was not significantly different from SMA at the final outcome visit at week 48. Diabetes quality of life improved more in the WM/WMA intervention initially but was not significantly different than SMA at the final outcome visit. WM/SMA participants had lower diabetes medication utilization (using a medication effect score) and greater weight loss than SMA participants at week 16 that was maintained at week 48. Limitations of the study are that WM/SMA intervention had more frequent visits in the first 16 weeks compared to SMA intervention, study physicians who performed medication adjustments were not blinded to treatment arm, and the medication effect score presumes a linear relationship between dosage and HbA1c. Impact: We tested a novel intervention that combined intensive weight and diabetes management using the SMA platform. This research addresses an important mission to VA because diabetes is more prevalent in veterans than in the general population, and because weight management is more challenging and complex in patients with diabetes. This study has the potential to enhance diabetes management strategies and benefit veterans with diabetes by delivering effective disease and weight management in a novel, economical, and efficient clinical system design. The study demonstrated that shared medical appointments incorporating intensive weight management led to substantial initial improvements in important diabetes outcomes. Maintaining intensity of WM/SMA intervention over time may increase durability of outcomes.

Abstract:	Background: Type 2 diabetes affects over 25 million adults in the US. Low socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minority populations, such as urban American Indian and Alaska Native peoples (AIAN), are disproportionately represented among Americans with diabetes and those at risk for diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes is more than twice as high among AIANs compared to whites (18% vs. 8%). The landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) demonstrated that lifestyle interventions are more effective for reducing the incidence of diabetes compared to medication and placebo. However, there is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of primary care-based translations of the DPP targeting patient-centered outcomes among minority populations who are at high risk of diabetes. Significant and prevalent psychosocial issues, such as stress, grief, and mental health conditions, among minority groups like urban AIAN may facilitate the progression from obesity to diabetes and hinder successful implementation of evidence-based lifestyle interventions. Effective patient-centered strategies to prevent diabetes among urban AIANs are urgently needed to eliminate health disparities in the US. Strategies developed for urban AIANs can be readily tailored for other low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations. Objectives: We aim to (1) engage patient and provider stakeholders to better understand the patient-centered perspective on psychosocial issues that influence progression to diabetes among urban AIANs; 2) strengthen, refine, and test an enhanced DPP that incorporates psychosocial support for urban AIANs in a randomized controlled trial; and 3) disseminate research findings to key stakeholders at the local, state, and national level. Methods: An ongoing strong collaboration between Stanford University Program on Prevention Outcomes and Practices and the Indian Health Center of Santa Clara Valley will guide all phases of the research project. The local American Indian Community Action Board will provide sincere patient involvement in all phases of the proposed research. We hypothesize that addressing psychosocial barriers within a culturally tailored DPP will result in superior patient-centered and clinical outcomes as compared to a standard DPP. We will test an enhanced DPP that addresses psychosocial barriers, comparing it to the standard DPP using a randomized clinical trial design (n=204). Obese (body mass index>30) self-identified urban AIANs with one or more non-weight related component of the metabolic syndrome will be randomized to the standard or enhanced DPP. Dual primary outcomes will include BMI (clinical) and quality of life (patient-oriented). Patient outcomes (projected): Diabetes and its prevention are of critical importance to the American Indian community. This project will provide evidence to urban AIANs and their providers on programs to interrupt the dysmetabolism pathway according to outcomes important to patients and providers.

Abstract:	Background: Using peer mentors to support health-related behavior change may be particularly effective in a VA setting where many patients lack social support on the one hand, but have latent bonds because of shared or similar veteran experiences. The research team has demonstrated that peer mentoring can help African American veterans with hard-to-manage diabetes mellitus improve their glucose control in the short term; however, it is unknown if demonstrated improvements in glucose control persist once mentoring stops and how to best sustain such programs. These are essential questions to address in order to successfully build a generalizable and scalable peer mentor program. This work builds on past and ongoing work with the aim of creating evidence-based, low-cost, easy-to-implement peer-mentoring programs that can sustainably support VA PACT efforts. Objectives: The current application sought to (1) test the effectiveness of a self-sustaining peer-mentoring program that trains former peer mentees to be peer mentors to support health-related behavior change in diabetic veterans with poor diabetes control; (2) assess the effects of becoming a mentor on those who were originally mentees, given a growing literature that being a mentor is good for your health; and (3) conduct a rigorous qualitative evaluation examining in-depth the mentor-mentee relationship, the transition to becoming a mentor, and exploring factors relevant to broader program implementation. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov number NCT01651117). In the first phase, poorly controlled diabetics were randomized to receive mentoring from well-controlled peers or to usual care. In the second phase, different poorly controlled diabetics were randomized to receive mentoring from peers who had been mentored in the first phase or to usual care. In addition, to assess whether becoming a mentor in phase 2 had any benefit for those who were mentored in phase 1, past mentees from phase 1 were randomized to either be a mentor in phase 2 or to usual care. Potential participants were identified through the electronic medical records (EMR). Diabetic patients were considered in poor control if they had HbA1c > 8% on at least 2 occasions in the 24 months prior to enrollment. Phase 1 potential mentors had to be in good control (with at least one HbA1c 7.5% in the 3 months prior to enrollment) but in previously poor control (at least one HbA1c > 8% in the 3 years prior to enrollment). Additional inclusion criteria included age 30 to 75, type II diabetic, access to telephone for contact with mentor/mentee, and ability to understand English. Mentor training consisted of an hour-long one-on-one training that was informed by motivational interviewing techniques. Mentors were contacted monthly to reinforce training and discuss interactions with their mentees. All participants received $50 for each in-person visit. Mentors also received $20 for each month in which they contacted or attempted to contact their mentee at least weekly. To achieve 80% power to detect a 0.8 unit change in A1c (standard error 1.6) between phase 2 mentors and non-mentors, a sample of 64 patients per arm was required. To protect against expected attrition (as seen in the pilot study), we inflated that by 10% to arrive at 72 participants per arm. Working backwards to determine how many poorly controlled diabetics would be needed in phase 1, we started with 144 (72 for each arm of phase 2) and inflated by 10% to arrive at 160, thus we intended to recruit 320 poorly controlled diabetics and randomize 1:1 to get 160 mentees and 160 usual care. After mid-study evaluation, with guidance from our Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), it was determined that resources were being wasted on such a large usual care group, so randomization was change to 2:1. Additionally, mid-study evaluation revealed that attrition was higher than expected. As a result, we recruited additional poorly controlled diabetics to phase 1 to have sufficient phase 2 mentors. All methodological changes were documented in protocol amendments, and approved by the IRB. All randomization was done using permuted blocks with varying block size using SAS Proc Plan. The primary outcome of interest was change in A1c from baseline to 6 months. Change in A1c from baseline to 12 months was a secondary outcome. Additional secondary outcomes included change from baseline of other measurements (LDL, systolic blood pressure, diabetes distress score, and depression score) at 6 and 12 months. All participants had a baseline, 6-, and 12-month visits during which A1c, LDL, blood pressure, weight and height were measured and several surveys were administered. Our basic model for all analyses was an analysis of covariance comparing change in outcome (A1c) from baseline to 6 months, adjusting for baseline (A1c). To also assess change from baseline to 12 months, we used a mixed-effects model and included a time fixed effects and a patient random effects. We also looked at dichotomized outcomes for A1c (1% improvement) using logistic regression. Subset analyses including only those who had a baseline HbA1c > 8% (since some patients who were recruited as poorly controlled based on the EMR showed good control at baseline). Approximately 13% of participants were missing 6-month A1c. To perform intent-to-treat analysis (which included all randomized patients except those who died during the intervention period), we used multiple imputation using Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods with 25 iterations. Analyses were conducted on each iteration and results were combined using Ruben's formula. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted to understand participants' experiences, their relationship with their partner, and how the intervention impacted their behavior. Purposive sampling was done to ensure adequate representation of mentees who made large strides in improving their A1c, those who made marginal improvements or got worse. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed for salient themes. Findings: Aim 1: We enrolled 365 poorly controlled veterans (158 into usual care and 207 into the intervention arm), 51% of those who were contacted and eligible into phase 1. Sixty-five were African American and 96% were male. Baseline biometrics were: A1c 9.5% (SD 1.6), LDL 95.4 mm/dl (SD 35.2), and SBP 137.4 mmHg (SD 18.4). The mean change in A1c was -0.20 (95% CI -0.46, 0.06) in usual care and -0.52 (95% CI -0.76, -0.29) for the intervention arm, (p=0.06). Sixty-seven people had, on enrollment, an A1c of 8%. When we limited the analysis to the 298 people with a baseline A1c > 8%, the mean change in A1c was -0.32 (95% CI -0.60, -0.05) for usual care and -0.75 (95% CI -1.01, -0.48) for the intervention arm, (p=0.03). For the intervention arm compared to usual care, the odds of dropping A1c by 1 point was 1.70 (95% CI 1.01, -2.86: p=0.05). There was no difference in A1c between arms at 12 months. The intervention did not influence LDL control, blood pressure control, diabetes distress, or depressive symptoms. For phase 2, we enrolled 122 people to receive mentoring from a former mentee (49 to usual care, 73 to the intervention). The mean change in A1c was -0.46 (95% CI -1.02, 0.10) in usual care and -0.08 (95% CI -0.42, 0.57) for the intervention arm, (p=0.16). Including the additional 158 people who had been randomized to control in phase 1 did not change these results. However, when we compared the change in A1c between those who received mentoring from a mentor who had been successful as a mentee (dropped A1c by 1% when a mentee) to those who had not, those who received mentoring from a past successful mentee dropped their A1c by -0.28 (95% CI -0.89, 0.34) compared to those who received mentoring from a past unsuccessful mentee 0.76 (95% CI -0.05, 1.57) (p=0.05). Mentees in this phase, at 6 months, showed significantly better improvement in diabetes distress score compared to usual care patients (0.10 usual care v -0.41, p=0.02). No other outcomes showed significant differences between usual care and mentees. As with the first phase, effects did not persist at 12 months. Aim 2: Seventy former mentees were randomized to becoming a mentor and 69 were randomized to be a non-mentor. Becoming a mentor did not prove beneficial to former mentees. Both mentors and non-mentors increased their A1c at 6 months (0.14 and 0.32, respectively, p=0.54). Aim 3: The intervention was well-received, with most participants describing it as valuable. Participants perceived the intervention to have many benefits, including having accessible support, increased self-confidence, increased accountability, increased self-efficacy, improved glucose control, and fulfilling a sense of altruism. Participants did encounter barriers, including logistical, interpersonal, and individual obstacles. Mentors struggled with mentees who were dealing with mental health or medical comorbidities and mentees struggled if they perceived their control to be better than their mentors. The more successful mentees tended to be more effusive in their description of their mentors, described a stronger sense of connection to their mentor, described a more structured interaction with their mentor, and tended to be more complimentary of the intervention. Impact: Relying on the inherent strengths of the veteran community, peer mentoring shows potential as a means to improving outcomes in patients with diabetes. Overall, this peer support program was well received but might be optimized by selecting naturally inclined mentors, providing additional training to introduce more structure into mentorship interactions, choosing mentors who have obtained a level of control, and targeting mentees who are not struggling with overwhelming comorbidities.

Abstract:	Diabetes incurs the most expensive annual chronic disease-related health care costs and certain ethnic groups, such as Latinos, are disproportionately affected by the burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Patients with T2DM also have comorbid chronic conditions that create complexities for proper management, and have implications for future research on integrating primary and behavioral care, particularly in disadvantaged groups. Cost-effective, sustainable, and patient-centered adaptations of evidence-based approaches to chronic disease management are needed to meet the needs of the most vulnerable, low-resource communities. Integrated Health Care is the care that results from a practice team of primary care and behavioral health clinicians working together with patients and using a systematic and cost-effective approach to provide patient-centered care for a defined population. This care may address mental health conditions, health behaviors, life stressors and crises, and clinical outcomes. Care integration is a cornerstone of effective integrated health care that leads to improved clinical and quality of life outcomes and reduces health-care costs and hospitalizations, especially in vulnerable populations. The goal of this project is to improve integrated care services at a federally-qualified Community Health Center (CHC). Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes (LUNA-D), is a randomized controlled trial that will test the effectiveness of an integrated behavioral health and primary care chronic care disease management intervention for low income T2DM Latino patients with 2 or more chronic conditions accessing care within San Ysidro Health Center (SYHC). The study aims are to 1) improve glycemic control, 2) improve cardiovascular risk profiles, 3) decrease psychological distress, and 4) evaluate the patient and provider acceptability and sustainability of the program. LUNA-D will recruit 414 non-insulin using adult T2DM patients with 2 or more chronic diseases. Half will be randomized to the Special Intervention (SI) and half to Usual Care (UC). The SI is a 3-month intensive intervention including fully integrated clinical visits with a mid-level provider (MLP) co-located with a behavioral health counselor (BHC) and peer-led evidence-based group health education sessions and proactive care coordination. Following the intense intervention period, the SI will receive booster sessions and fully integrated MLP/BHC clinical visits across 9 additional months. Usual Care is represented by passive appointments with the primary care physician and passive referrals to behavioral health and traditional health education. HbA1C measurements will be taken at baseline, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to detect changes in glycemic control. Clinical lab measures, medication adherence, weight, health behaviors and psychosocial measures will also be obtained across the study. Demonstration of clinical improvement will support adoption by the SYHC.

Abstract:	Background: This career development award (CDA) will improve management of veterans with persistent poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (PPDM). Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, limb amputation, and blindness among veterans, is a risk factor for heart attack, stroke, and mortality, and is among the most costly diseases to VA. Complications and costs rise exponentially as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) increases, so veterans with PPDM (defined as having HbA1c continuously > 9% for > 1 year despite VA primary care or endocrinology management) are among the highest-risk diabetes patients within VA. However, this high risk could be modified with improved glycemic control. Objectives: Given their disproportionate contribution to diabetes complications and costs, novel approaches to managing veterans with PPDM are needed. Two evidence gaps currently hinder the development of interventions targeting these veterans: 1) the optimal diabetes management content to address factors underlying PPDM in veterans is unclear; and 2) the ideal intervention delivery strategy for veterans with PPDM is not known. This CDA will address these gaps and generate a novel intervention specifically designed to improve diabetes control among veterans with PPDM. This CDA hypothesizes that this intervention will be effective if it 1) delivers content targeting specific barriers to improvement among veterans with PPDM; and 2) utilizes a patient-centered delivery strategy that facilitates frequent patient-provider contact in a manner consistent with this group's preferences. Methods: This CDA comprises three complementary specific aims, and a theoretical framework based on the health belief model guides this research. For aim 1, existing data will be analyzed to identify patient factors associated with PPDM in veterans. Per our theoretical model, these factors will point toward barriers to improvement in PPDM, which in turn will guide the selection of intervention content. Aim 2 will utilize qualitative methodology to query stakeholders regarding perceived barriers and facilitators of diabetes control in PPDM, which will further refine intervention content. Additional qualitative work will define the intervention delivery strategy/strategies preferred by veterans with PPDM for facilitating frequent patient-provider contact. Aim 3 will utilize data from aims 1 and 2 to design and pilot test a novel intervention specifically targeting veterans with PPDM. Impact: This CDA will create a patient-centered treatment option for veterans with PPDM, a group that comprises the most poorly controlled, highest risk diabetes patients in the VA system. In so doing, this CDA aligns with strategic goals of the Diabetes QUERI and eHealth QUERI, and has relevance to multiple VA HSR&D strategic priorities. Ultimately, by using a high-impact intervention to address a costly condition in a high-risk population, this CDA has great potential significance to VA and will impact a costly condition in a high-risk population of veterans.

Abstract:	The Marshallese population suffers from a significant and disproportionate burden of type 2 diabetes. The rate of type 2 diabetes among the Marshallese is one of the highest of any population group in the world--at least 400% higher than the general US population. Prior attempts to implement diabetes self-management education (DSME) in Marshallese populations have failed to produce even short-term results. Based on qualitative interviews using a CBPR process, we hypothesize that an adapted extended family model of DSME, based on the collectivist, family-centered values of the Marshallese community, will result in better diabetes management outcomes compared to traditional DSME. Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach and an interdisciplinary research team, we will employ the cultural adaptation process (CAP) to modify and test the DSME as implemented within an extended family model. Aim 1 is to adapt the DSME for implementation within an extended family model. Aim 2 is to conduct a comparative effectiveness evaluation using a randomized control trial design that compares the results of the extended family model of DSME with traditional DSME. Two local Marshallese organizations, two community co-investigators from the Marshallese community, three community clinics, 31 Marshallese stakeholders, and an extended group of Marshallese, Pacific Islander, and diabetes experts were involved in this grant application and will continue to be involved throughout the research process. This research is highly translational. The impact of the study will help bridge the gap between knowledge of an effective DSME intervention and actual implementation of the intervention among a Pacific Islander population with especially high rates of type 2 diabetes and significant health disparities.

Abstract:	Despite Latinos being the largest ethnic minority, with almost 56.5 million Latinos living in the US, they are one of the most medically underserved groups. Latina women have one of the highest rates of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the U.S. Moreover, GDM is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), with up to 60% of women developing T2DM within 10 years of a GDM pregnancy. Given the growing obesity epidemic, rates of GDM and T2DM are likely to increase in the absence of preventive interventions. Addressing the risk of T2DM after GDM is critical to reducing health disparities faced by Latina women. The postpartum period is widely recognized as representing a "window of opportunity" to improve the future health of women who have had complicated pregnancies, including GDM. However, delivery of preventive interventions is challenging due to systems-related factors, including lack of time and resources for providers to provide lifestyle modification counseling, as well as patient challenges, including multiple demands of the postpartum period, leaving little time for women to engage in preventive activities. Technology can help overcome these barriers, as demonstrated by the success of our web-based CDC-funded Balance after Baby (BAB) intervention, which successfully promoted weight loss in women with recent GDM. Qualitative results from BAB, which revealed that women strongly wanted the program delivered via an app, led us, in partnership with Latina women with recent GDM, to develop a phase I m-health intervention program for Latina women, called Hola Bebe, Adios Diabetes!, in which we tested the preliminary effectiveness of a mobile app in reducing risk factors for the development of T2DM in Latina women who had GDM in the prior 5 years. The proposed phase II application builds on the promising phase I results, which showed acceptability of the program, increased self-efficacy for healthy lifestyle, and weight loss in Latina women with recent GDM. Phase II specific aims are as follows: (aim 1) enhance Hola Bebe to include a) an IOS version, b) integrated databases and data analytics to enable population health management and reporting, and c) expanded content based on phase I participant recommendations; and (aim 2) evaluate the effectiveness of Hola Bebe in RCT with Latina women with recent GDM. We hypothesize that participants receiving Hola Bebe will show increased self-efficacy for healthy eating and physical activity (primary outcomes), greater weight loss (secondary outcomes), and a greater decrease in HbA1C levels (exploratory hypothesis) compared to controls. Successful achievement of study aims will result in a culturally tailored, user-centered, low-cost, high-reach, and easy-to-use evidence-based m-health intervention to reduce risk factors for T2DM in Latina women with a recent history of GDM. The intervention can help reduce the stark ethnic disparities in T2DM among the Latino population while providing a model for an m-health solution that addresses the many systems-based, time, and cost barriers to preventive care typically seen in community-based settings.

Abstract:	This proposal addresses the growing public health problem of diabetes, a disease that affects the ability of the body to process sugars from foods. For the patient, diabetes and its complications such as reduced vision and pain can affect quality of life and ability to function on a day-to-day basis in a serious way. The course of diabetes can be changed dramatically with lifestyle changes, such as healthy eating and increasing physical activity. However, traditional approaches (face-to-face counseling in clinics, individual visits with a diabetes educator, or group classes) are not sufficient to improve health in patients with diabetes. The overall goal of this proposal is to enhance the supports and resources available to patients with diabetes to assist them to achieve their health goals. We will develop and evaluate an innovative program using nurse health coaching using motivational interviewing techniques, wireless sensor and mobile health (mHealth) technology based on input from patient, provider, and technology experts as to how best to address the health care needs of persons living with diabetes and improve their health and wellness. Specific aims: Aim 1 is to partner with stakeholders (patients and providers) to revise and finalize the proposed intervention elements (nurse coaching, wireless sensor technology and mHealth framework, relevant outcomes). Aim 2 is to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of integrating patient-generated goals and sensor data into a mHealth dashboard linked back into primary care practice. Aim 3 is to evaluate the effectiveness of the P2E2T2 program on diabetes management as measured by the following outcomes prioritized by patients in preliminary studies: quality of life, self-efficacy, readiness to change, and clinically relevant indicators. Relevance: The focus of this proposal is to attend to patient voice regarding what is needed from the health care team and from technology to optimally support patients to succeed in reaching self-identified health goals to better manage their diabetes. Diabetes management is ultimately in the hands of the patient who is expert on their own circumstances, motivations, and beliefs. Together, health care providers and technology can provide support, education, and coaching to assist patients to meet their goals. We anticipate iterative design of the program as we regularly involve our patient, provider, and technical expert stakeholders throughout the project. Current electronic health record (EHR) structure is focused on recording medical problems and the prescriptions providers generate, with no place to capture health goals set by the patient. We believe a fundamental shift is needed to not only include the patient in their care plan, but to highlight to the health care team through the electronic integration of an mHealth dashboard those areas which the patient identifies as holding the highest level of importance.

Abstract:	Cardiovascular (CV) events are the most common cause of death in adults with type 2 diabetes. While the benefits and safety of commonly used blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol medications are well established, much less is known about the CV benefits and CV risks of commonly used glucose-control strategies involving treatment with multiple glucose-lowering agents. To address this important clinical and public health concern, this project examines detailed clinical data from 1.3 million adults with treated type 2 diabetes over a 13-year period to quantify the impact of specific combinations of glucose-lowering agents on myocardial infarction, stroke, CV mortality, total mortality, and congestive heart failure (CHF) hospitalizations. We test four comparative effectiveness hypotheses to determine whether major CV events are differentially related to (a) use of specific two-agent combinations of metformin with sulfonylurea (SU), thiazolidinedione (TZD), DPP-4 inhibitors, or GLP-1 receptor agonists; (b) use of specific two-agent combinations of metformin with SU, TZD, DPP-4 inhibitors, or GLP-1 receptors agonists when basal insulin is added; (c) addition of prandial insulin in subjects already using basal insulin; and (d) treatment with human insulin versus analog insulin. Analysis employs modern comparative effectiveness statistical approaches, including new user designs and marginal structural modeling (MSM) with inverse probability weighting (IPW) and targeted minimal loss-based estimation (TMLE) which, under certain conditions, allow proper adjustment for time-dependent confounders on the causal pathway between early exposures and clinical outcomes, as well as proper adjustment for selection bias due to informative censoring. The study results have the potential to substantially improve CV outcomes in millions of Americans with type 2 diabetes by identifying which commonly used glucose-lowering regimens maximize CV benefits and minimize CV risks.

Abstract:	Impaired glucose metabolism (gestational diabetes [GDM] and mild hyperglycemia) that occurs during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for pregnancy complications and is also an early indication of long-term metabolic dysfunction leading to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In the US, GDM is commonly diagnosed using a two-step screening and diagnostic approach. The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) proposed a one-step diagnostic approach that broadens the definition of GDM by lowering the cutoff values to include women with milder forms of hyperglycemia, who would have screened normal under the current two-step approach. The goal of these recommendations is better identification of women at risk for pregnancy complications and long-term metabolic dysfunction, but it results in a significant increase in the prevalence of GDM. The NIH Gestational Diabetes Consensus Development Conference committee does not recommend changing from the current two-step screening/diagnostic approach to the IADPSG one-step diagnostic approach without trials demonstrating that increasing the number of women diagnosed as having GDM results in better outcomes. In this application, we aim to 1) conduct a "real world" randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine differences in short-term perinatal health outcomes with GDM testing between the two predominant GDM screening approaches, and 2) prospectively follow the mothers to examine their metabolic risk profiles and the growth of their infants at one year postpartum. Based on a pilot feasibility study, we propose a single-site blinded RCT of 920 pregnant women at 18-24 weeks' gestation between ages 18-45 years who have not been diagnosed with diabetes, with a singleton pregnancy. Participants will have a non-fasting 1 hour 50 gm glucose challenge test (GCT) performed between 24-28 weeks gestation. Women with 50 gm GCT results < 200 mg/dL will be randomized to receive either a fasting 2-hour 75 gm oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or a 3-hour 100 gm OGTT. GDM will be diagnosed using the IADPSG criteria for women receiving the 75 gm OGTT and Carpenter-Coustan criteria for women receiving the 100 gm. Participants and their physicians will be informed of the diagnosis of GDM, but will be blinded to the specific test results and criteria used to make the diagnosis. Participants with GDM will receive treatment as determined by their primary physician or midwife, and all participants will continue routine prenatal care. Brief questionnaires will be used to assess participants' and physicians' views on GDM testing. Metabolic profiles for participants will be assessed at randomization and at a year postpartum. The primary outcome measure is large-for-gestational age fetal growth. The rationale for the proposed research is that this is a unique opportunity to compare the two methods. At the end of the study, we will know whether women diagnosed at lower glucose levels with the IADPSG criteria are more likely to have adverse perinatal outcomes. It is our hypothesis that using IADPSG diagnostic criteria will result in detection of more women with impaired glucose metabolism and that treating these women will reduce adverse perinatal outcomes and prevent long-term metabolic dysfunction. This study will provide data grounded in level A evidence, to evaluate the two screening methods so universal guidelines for GDM screening can be endorsed by major organizations and implemented into clinical care.

Abstract:	Addressing the epidemic of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus in the United States (US) is a top public health priority. More than 25.6 million adults have type 2 diabetes, and 45% of patients have inadequate glycemic control. Every year, poorly controlled diabetes is responsible for $58 billion in medical expenditures. Vulnerable populations including racial and ethnic minorities and individuals living in poverty typically have the highest rates of inadequate glycemic control, often resulting in avoidable and costly healthcare utilization. As such, the U.S. health care system urgently needs to improve diabetes management, particularly for vulnerable populations. Diabetes self-management education is known to improve the self-care behaviors of individuals. Increasingly, individuals with diabetes have access to diabetes self-management education in primary care settings, group classes, and over the internet and telephone, yet disparities persist. To date, it is unknown whether vulnerable populations in the U.S. have equal access to diabetes self-management education compared to other less vulnerable adults with type 2 diabetes. In addition, it is unclear whether vulnerable populations with access to diabetes self-management education have similar diabetic outcomes, health care utilization, and/or medical expenditures to other less vulnerable adults with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, in a nationally representative, population-based study the specific aims of this research are 1) to describe receipt of diabetes self-management education in racial and ethnic minorities and individuals living in poverty with type 2 diabetes, compared to other adults with type 2 diabetes; 2) to determine the extent to which receipt of diabetes self-management education mediates or moderates race/ethnicity and income-related disparities in hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, and cholesterol; and 3) to determine the extent to which receipt of diabetes self-management education mediates or moderates race/ethnicity- and income-related disparities in diabetes-related health care utilization and medical expenditures. This study is directly in line with the mission of National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Disease to support research on diabetes to improve people's health and quality of life. Ultimately, this research will identify important points of intervention for the delivery and effectiveness of diabetes self-management education. This research will be carried out as part of a broader training program characterized by (a) a highly motivated MD-PhD applicant who has demonstrated excellence in the pursuit of a degree in the academically rigorous, multidisciplinary field of population health sciences; (b) exceptional research training and mentoring by co-sponsors Dr. Elizabeth Jacobs and Dr. John Mullahy; (c) a world-class institutional environment, including a MD/PhD program with a distinguished track record of successfully training clinician-investigators; (d) outstanding opportunities for clinical experience in internal medicine; and (e) a well-thought out program of learning, research, and clinical experiences that will serve to train the applicant to be an independent and productive physician-scientist.

Abstract:	In hemodialysis (HD) patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), the risk of developing diabetes-related complications and mortality is high. However, data on the associations among diabetes control, treatment, and diabetes-related complications in HD patients with DM are extremely limited. In addition, racial and ethnic differences in these relationships have not been documented. Objectives: The objective of this observational study is to assess the relationship among glycemic control, oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) therapy, and both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular outcomes in HD patients with DM. We will also explore racial and ethnic differences in these associations. Methods: We will use data from the U.S. Renal Data System and electronic medical records of DaVita, Inc., to conduct a retrospective cohort study of patients on HD with diabetes mellitus at a large national provider of dialysis services to examine the associations among HbA1c and various clinical outcomes (specific aims 1 and 2). A subset of these patients will be used for a comparative effectiveness study of patients receiving TZD or sulfonylurea monotherapy (specific aim 3). For the first two aims, we will use Cox proportional hazards models to assess the associations between HbA1c and time to primary outcomes of interest, and test for effect modification by race and ethnicity by including interaction terms and performing a Wald test. We will further explore contrasts between different racial and ethnic groups upon finding significant interaction terms. For specific aim 3, we will compare prevalent and incident users of TZDs to users of sulfonylureas by limiting all analyses to patients receiving monotherapy with one of these two drug classes. We will examine the association between OAD monotherapy (TZD vs. sulfonylurea) and HbA1c by performing a repeated-measures analysis using linear regression models with a robust sandwich estimator. We will also analyze the association between OAD monotherapy (TZD vs. sulfonylurea) and time to cardiovascular events and death using Cox proportional hazards models. We will further conduct as-treated and intention-to-treat analyses in addition to other sensitivity analyses, and employ advanced statistical methods, including propensity score techniques. Racial and ethnic differences in these associations will be investigated using the method described above for the first two aims. Significance: This research study will take advantage of an unusually large and detailed dataset of patients initiating HD. Due to the limited data on the associations among diabetes management and treatment, including glycemic control and OAD therapy, and diabetes complications in HD patients with DM, additional studies are warranted in this high-risk population. Moreover, our study will have the ability to investigate racial and ethnic differences in these associations as we capitalize on the enormous size of the database that will be available for analysis.

Abstract:	The overall objective of this proposal is identify and compare federally qualified health centers' (FQHCs') eye care screening and treatment for diabetic retinopathy while controlling for an array of socioeconomic, demographic, and other related factors. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness among United States (US) adults 40 years and older. Little is known about the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in the growing US minority, low-income, and uninsured population. Chicago is the third most populous city in the US and comprises 2.7 million people within the city limits, and approximately 10 million in the metropolitan area. It includes multiple world class medical centers, over 70 distinct communities and most segregated areas associated with some of the largest health disparities in the country. The FQHCs are community-based organizations that provide standardized comprehensive care services to persons of all ages, regardless of their ability to pay, and are a critical component of the health care safety net. Many FQHC patients are minorities, do not have insurance, and would otherwise lack access to basic medical care. Providing insight into screening, diagnosis, and treatment (if any) will help to identify areas with greatest need for immediate intervention. The highly innovative Chicago Health Information Technology Regional Extension Center (CHITREC) is an existing database and offers the opportunity to track individual patients (over 2 million in the city of Chicago) across the fragmented health care system to better understand diabetic eye disease, screening, and treatments in the underserved and minorities. Our aims seek to identify all patients in CHITREC with a diagnosis of diabetes and classify them into three groups (non-FQHC utilization group, FQHC utilization without the presence of an ophthalmologist or optometrist, and FQHC utilization with the presence of an ophthalmologist or optometrist) and assess the difference in the rates of annual eye exams, disease detection, and treatment among these three groups. Aim 1 will estimate the number of diabetics with an annual eye care exam, and aim 2 will estimate the diabetic retinopathy detection, treatment rate, and time to treatment. We will use descriptive techniques and regression models to study utilization and treatments accounting for the site and location, socioeconomic, and demographic factors. This proposal allows for the strategic planning with analyses aimed at identifying the areas with the greatest need for the planned placement and infusion of additional ophthalmologists and resources directed at ameliorating the identified health disparities. Subsequently we shall test the use of non-mydratic cameras as an equivalence trial as a long-term cost effective screening strategy for the underserved patients identified and analyzed.

Abstract:	The number of youth with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. is projected to increase by a staggering 49 percent by 2050, with higher rates among minority youth. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is recognized as a sentinel study demonstrating the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions for diabetes prevention among pre-diabetic adults but has not yet been replicated in youth. In addition, such intensive interventions are often not sustainable in high-risk communities with limited resources. One strategy that has been successfully employed in adults from such communities is peer-based health education. Research suggests that, like adults, young people are more likely to hear and personalize messages, and thus to change their attitudes and behaviors, if they believe the messenger is similar to them and faces the same concerns and pressures. However, there have been no peer-led interventions in ethnic minority teens and no interventions focused specifically on weight loss for diabetes prevention. Finally, another challenge identified in existing youth health intervention programs is keeping youth engaged to enhance program participation and impact. One potential strategy is the use of mobile technologies (text messaging, mobile applications, social media) to support weight management programs, but to date use of such technologies has not been studied in youth. This proposal's overall objective is to use community-based participatory research (CBPR) to develop and pilot test a youth peer-led diabetes prevention intervention incorporating novel mobile health technologies for at-risk adolescents in a vulnerable New York City community. The central hypothesis is that such an intervention will lead to maintenance or decrease in BMI; improved dietary, physical activity, and weight control behaviors; and a decrease in diabetes risk. The specific aims are to 1) explore strategies for using peer educators and novel mobile health technologies as part of a group lifestyle change program for diabetes prevention among at-risk ethnic minority youth in a New York City community with high disease burden; 2) design, pilot test, and evaluate preliminary outcomes for the intervention. Using data from aim 1, we will use CBPR to translate a proven adult peer-led diabetes prevention intervention into a developmentally and culturally appropriate lifestyle intervention for pre-diabetic ethnic minority adolescents. We will then screen at-risk adolescents for pre-diabetes and related lifestyle and biological measures and compare outcomes in pre-diabetic adolescents in intervention and wait list control groups to test intervention effectiveness; and 3) further refine the pilot intervention for a larger RCT based on an examination of intervention feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability.

Abstract:	Complications of diabetes such as retinopathy, renal failure, amputation, stroke, and myocardial infarction have a major impact on the wellbeing of patients with diabetes and cause high rates of death. To delay progression of complications, control symptoms, and prevent mortality, a spectrum of medical care is needed, including high acuity physician visits, advanced diagnostic tests, and invasive therapy. A rapidly growing form of health coverage--high-deductible insurance--substantially increases patients' out-of-pocket costs for such services. Families in high-deductible health plans must pay up to $12,000 per year before more comprehensive coverage begins. High cost-sharing levels are intended to encourage more efficient and higher quality care but could also reduce access to services that treat complications and save lives. It is essential to understand how high-deductible health plans affect micro- and macrovascular outcomes in diabetes. Suboptimal access could reduce detection of complications, accelerate disease progression, and increase deaths. This proposal seeks to assess the impact of high-deductible health plans on micro- and macrovascular diabetes complications and on the care that affects them, including physician visits, diagnostic testing, and major therapies. Our measure of physician visits will comprise outpatient and emergency department visits with specific diagnoses potentially related to diabetes complications, and we will classify emergency department visits as high or lower severity. The diagnostic tests we will examine include retinal imaging, renal biopsy, peripheral angiography, advanced brain imaging, and cardiac catheterization. We will further assess whether tests for coronary heart disease are used inappropriately to screen patients with diabetes. Our composite measure of therapy for macrovascular complications will include lower extremity bypass grafting, thrombolysis, and coronary artery stenting. To assess health outcomes, we will examine a composite measure of microvascular complications assessing treatment for advanced retinopathy and need for dialysis or renal transplant. Our composite macrovascular outcome will include lower extremity amputation, myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. This study will include a 15-year rolling sample of 71,000 diabetes patients whose employers mandated a switch from traditional to high-deductible health plans. We will use employer- and member-level propensity score matching to minimize selection bias. The study will employ strong quasi-experimental designs including interrupted time series with comparison series and Kaplan-Meier survival curves to examine outcomes of interest. This project will be the first to examine these research questions on a national scale.

Abstract:	The twin epidemics of obesity and diabetes affect most Americans: 70% of US adults are overweight or obese, 26 million have diabetes, and 79 million people have pre-diabetes. While diet and exercise improve outcomes in diabetes, most people with type 2 diabetes eat an unhealthy diet, do little physical activity, and have trouble making and sustaining changes in health behavior. The Look AHEAD trial demonstrated that an intensive lifestyle intervention that teaches skills necessary to make changes in diet and activity led to sustained weight loss, diabetes remission, lower rates of complications, medication reduction, and improved physical fitness and quality of life compared to diabetes support and education. This project will adapt the highly effective but resource-intensive Look AHEAD intensive lifestyle intervention so that it may be delivered with fewer resources in community health center settings, potentially via telephone, greatly expanding its potential reach and impact. Pilot data show feasibility and effectiveness comparable to the Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention: lifestyle group participants lost 6.7% of body weight compared to 2.6% in the individual medical nutrition therapy (MNT) arm (P=0.003) and had twice as much reduction in medications. In this project, we will compare two different implementation strategies for delivery of this group adaptation of the Look AHEAD intensive lifestyle intervention, one using an in-person approach and one using a telephone approach, to dietitian referral for individual medical nutrition therapy in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes. The interventions will take place at three community health centers. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Aim 1 is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the adapted Look AHEAD lifestyle change interventions in a three-arm trial comparing random assignment to in-person (IP) group (n=70) and telephone conference call (TCC) group (n=70) implementation strategies to standard of care defined as individual MNT (control; n=70). Medical outcomes will include weight loss (primary), glycemic control, cardiac risk factors, medication dose, and cost. Behavioral outcomes include self-efficacy and health-related quality of life. Aim 2 is to evaluate the reach, adoption, implementation fidelity, and maintenance of the adapted Look AHEAD lifestyle change program in in-person and telephone call implementation strategies at the three community health center settings, comparing factors across centers using the RE-AIM Model Dimension items checklist and employing a mixed-methods approach, including focus groups and structured interviews. Aim 3 is to estimate the incremental cost per percentage point decrease in body weight of the implementation strategies assessed in this study compared to usual care. If effective, materials with estimates of approximate implementation costs from this project can be readily disseminated for use in usual care settings throughout the United States.

Abstract:	There is a pressing need to improve outcomes for patients with diabetes, especially patients from underserved communities. Patients with diabetes have high levels of depressive symptoms that lead to poor engagement in care and worse overall health function. Integrated care for depression and diabetes has been shown to help improve clinical outcomes. However, many patients with depressive symptoms and diabetes, especially traditionally underserved groups, have other priorities such as financial, social, and emotional concerns that affect their care. This K18 career enhancement award in patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) proposes, through a program of mentoring, formal coursework, and a linked research project, to build skills in PCOR methods and utilize a participatory approach to inspire a new services delivery model for diabetes care. The basis of this model would be to include patients' nonbiomedical needs as part of primary care treatment discussions and decisions. Partnering with patients, physicians, and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) as stakeholders, our first phase will use mixed-methods to determine the range of biomedical (physical symptoms, diet, and exercise) and nonbiomedical (financial, social and emotional) needs patients with depressive symptoms and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) may wish to address in the context of their health. These needs will be used to populate a prioritization card-sort task that will be used to create a personalized management plan that empowers patients to prioritize their own needs within an integrated care intervention. The second phase will prepare for a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial by pilot testing an integrated depression and type 2 DM intervention plus patient prioritized planning in primary care patients with depressive symptoms and type 2 DM and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) > 8% from urban clinics serving primarily older low-income minority populations. Function will be our primary patient-centered outcome because of the importance patients place on being able to manage one's life circumstances. The intervention is carried out by health care staff already on site, thus facilitating its implementation in real-world practices with limited resources and competing demands. Our goal is to close the health disparities gap in diabetes care among traditionally underserved groups including older adults, those in inner city areas, and members of minority groups.

Abstract:	Background: Diabetes mellitus is a highly prevalent chronic condition, affecting one in four veterans who use the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Patient self-management is critical for controlling diabetes and reducing its cardiovascular sequela. Providing diabetic patients with effective whole health training and self-management support can be challenging, due to time constraints at primary care encounters and limited clinician training with behavior change. We have previously demonstrated that a group-based, VA primary care intervention can help patients set highly effective, evidence-based diabetes goals, resulting in improved diabetes self-efficacy and hemoglobin (Hb) A1c levels. This study aims to evaluate the process of implementing a collaborative goal setting intervention personalized to patient activation and health literacy levels (i.e. Empowering Patients in Chronic Care [EPIC]) into routine PACT care in five VA facilities across two VISNs and to evaluate the effectiveness and patient-centeredness of this intervention relative to usual care. Objectives: Specific aim 1 is to assess effective processes for and costs associated with implementing a collaborative diabetes goal setting intervention personalized to patient activation and FHL (i.e., EPIC) into the routine workflows of VISN 12 PACTs. H1: Formative measures within the PARIHS framework (evidence, context, facilitation) will be associated with implementation of EPIC (defined by reach, adoption, cost-effectiveness, and fidelity measures) into routine PACT care. Specific aim 2 is to evaluate the effectiveness of delivering collaborative goal setting personalized to patient activation and functional health literacy (FHL) on clinical (HbA1c) and patient-centered (Diabetes Distress Scale) outcomes among eligible patients in enrolled PACTs. H2: Patients receiving collaborative goal-setting personalized to activation and FHL levels will have significant improvements in a) HbA1c and b) Diabetes Distress Scale levels, respectively, at 6 months (post-intervention) compared with patients receiving enhanced usual care. H3: Patients receiving collaborative goal-setting personalized to activation and FHL levels will maintain significant improvements in a) HbA1c and b) Diabetes Distress Scale levels at 1-year follow-up, respectively, compared with patients receiving enhanced usual care. Methods: In phase 1 of the study, we implemented EPIC into routine PACT care. We conducted a mixed-methods formative evaluation that included 35 key informant interviews with VISN 12 leadership, clinicians, and staff and an assessment of organizational readiness for change. This evaluation identified how group and one-on-one sessions of EPIC can best be implemented into routine PACT workflows. In phase 2, we conducted a randomized clinical trial enrolling 280 veterans, from a projected sample of 284, with poorly controlled diabetes (defined by average hemoglobin A1c of >= 8%). Veterans were randomized at the patient level to receive EPIC or enhanced usual care (EUC). Consented subjects were allocated evenly between EPIC and EUC. EPIC consisted of six 1-hour group sessions focusing on 1) Your Health, Your Values; 2) Diabetes ABCs; 3) Setting Goals and Making Action Plans; 4) Communication with Your Health Care Provider; 5) Staying Committed to Your Goals; and 6) Reviewing and Planning for the Future. After each group session, a one-on-one goal coaching session between an EPIC clinician, drawn from the local PACT staff, and veteran participants focused on collaborative goal setting. EPIC coaches were trained to personalize goal setting using patient-reported activation and health literacy data. We collected laboratory and survey data at baseline, post-intervention, and post-maintenance phase. We evaluated the effectiveness of personalized goal setting compared to enhanced usual care on clinical (e.g., hemoglobin A1c) and patient-centered (e.g., Diabetes Distress Scale) outcomes. Findings: In the phase 1 formative evaluation of implementation, we conducted 35 in-depth, qualitative interviews from a snowball sample of staff actively engaged in VISN 12 diabetes management (PACT members and Health Promotion Disease Prevention staff) and facility leadership. Consistent with the PARIHS framework, interviews elicited information about participants' existing knowledge regarding group education programs (Evidence); physical and social climate at each target facility (Context); and clinicians' preparedness and intentions to participate (Facilitation). Analysis was dictated by thematic saturation. We identified consistent implementation needs across five VISN 12 facilities. All facilities desired a collaborative culture, but differed in their actual level of existing collaborations. Participants' concerns involved lack of leadership support for diabetes-related programs, inadequate staffing, difficulty balancing EPIC with existing responsibilities, and overlap between the intervention and ongoing diabetes programs. Some participants raised concerns about the intensity of the intervention, given the health literacy and activation of the target patient population. We addressed implementation needs through open, ongoing communication, partnership building, and engagement with diabetes care staff and leadership at target facilities. We promoted successful collaboration by identifying mechanisms to meet participants' goals while simultaneously meeting EPIC project goals. We used the shared medical appointment mechanism to address staffing and workload issues, and incentivized participation with CEU credits to meet existing training responsibilities for intervention staff. Based on partner feedback, we modified patient training materials and expanded the intervention dose from 4 to 6 sessions to meet the needs of the low health literacy patient population. In the phase 2 randomized-controlled trial of EPIC implementation, a total of five sites actively participated in the intervention delivery: the Hines VA Hospital in Hines, IL, and the associated Joliet Community-Based Outpatient Clinic in Joliet, IL, the Jesse Brown VAMC in downtown Chicago, and the associated Adam Benjamin, Jr. community-based outpatient clinic in Crown Point, IN, as well as the Michael E. DeBakey VAMC in Houston, TX. Sites implemented 100% of expected groups; a total of 25 group cohorts were delivered between the sites during the intervention window from July 2015-July 2017. Groups ranged in size from 2-10 veterans, with an average group size of 6 veterans. Overall, 280 veterans were recruited to participate, meeting 99% of the target sample of 284 veterans. Allocation between the treatment and control groups was exactly even at 140 veterans each. Baseline characteristics of our patient participants suggest that participants randomized to the EPIC and EUC arms of the study were statistically not significantly different from each other on key characteristics such as their baseline HbA1C, DDS, and potential co-variates (e.g., demographics). The only exception is that the number of participants with prior diabetes education was greater for participants in the EUC arm compared to the EPIC arm (X2(1)=8.44, p=0.004). Those assigned to the EPIC arm had significantly greater improvement in HbA1c levels from baseline to post-intervention, relative to those assigned to the EUC arm (F=9.12, p=0.003, d=0.36 (95% CI=0.12, 0.59)). However, this difference was not maintained at the post-maintenance time point (F=0.29, p=0.60, d=0.06 (95% CI=-0.17, 0.30). We found statistically significant improvements in Diabetes Distress Scale scores among EPIC veterans relative to controls at both the post-intervention (F=9.06, p=0.003, d=0.37 (95% CI=0.13, 0.60) and post-maintenance time points (F=8.94, p=0.003, d=0.36 (95% CI=0.12, 0.59). The significant improvements all reflect mild to moderate effect sizes that build on the effectiveness of usual care. Data from qualitative analyses demonstrated that both veterans and clinicians endorsed participation in the EPIC intervention, with veterans citing approval for the peer support and personalized approach to goal setting incumbent to the intervention. Clinicians endorsed the exposure and practical application of clinical skills, like motivational interviewing, interprofessional collaboration, and shared decision making. Impact: Integration of patient-reported measures into routine care should aid PACT providers in personalizing goals and action plans for veterans with treated but uncontrolled diabetes. Having PACT members conduct the personalized goal setting will improve clinical and patient-centered outcomes because patient goals/action plans can better align with the PACT treatment plan. PACT personnel will gain a greater understanding of patients' challenges and problems related to diabetes self-care, and patients will likely gain a deeper appreciation of diabetes self-management through collaborative goal-setting. Information gained from this work will provide greater understanding of the role of collaborative goal-setting in targeting high-risk patient populations within the PACT setting and could be extended to other chronic conditions. The profile of clinicians delivering the intervention varies by clinical site. Nationwide adoption of this intervention is possible because of widespread implementation of PACT in the VA and the flexibility in the staffing patterns of delivery. Furthermore, deliberate efforts to engage PACT personnel in the planning and implementation of the effectiveness study will enhance the potential impact and feasibility of adoption across VA PACTs. We have concluded the interventional phase of the project and are conducting data analysis currently that will further elucidate the project impact. Given that our findings support EPIC's effectiveness, we are currently exploring different potential funding opportunities that will enable us to implement and disseminate the program more broadly. To date, we have secured funding from our partners in VISN 12 to disseminate the project more broadly throughout the VISN. This funding has enabled us to create an EPIC toolkit to ensure the program is embedded long-term, accounting for products and processes traditionally accomplished by members of the research staff. These elements include 1) a sustainable process map for veteran identification and scheduling, 2) a decision tree for EPIC coach identification, 3) EES-accredited E-learning platform for EPIC coach training, 4) a clinic profile request form to ensure creation of an EPIC clinic, 5) revised and updated EPIC manuals, 6) frequently asked question guide for facilitators, and 7) a SharePoint site to house EPIC materials and instructions. Our partners in Crown Point, IN have utilized the EPIC toolkit and are currently running a cohort of veterans without support from any research staff.

Abstract:	Background: Latinos are the largest and fastest growing minority group (16% of the U.S. population) and provide a potent example of existing health disparities among U.S. racial/ethnic groups. In particular, Mexican Americans--the largest U.S. Latino subpopulation--have a notably higher prevalence of overweight and obesity (80%) than non-Hispanic whites (NHWs, 68%), and they are disproportionately affected by obesity-related risk factors (e.g., metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes) and diseases (e.g., diabetes). Until efficacious lifestyle interventions for weight management are translated into practice, obesity and its comorbidities will continue to exact enormous and disproportionate burdens. Population-specific interventions are needed because undifferentiated interventions (often developed in white-dominant populations) may be inefficient--or even unintentionally increase health disparities. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) trial demonstrated that an intensive lifestyle intervention reduced type 2 diabetes incidence by 58% among high-risk adults and that weight loss was the dominant predictor. Numerous DPP translation studies have been undertaken, including a pragmatic randomized trial our team recently completed ("E-LITE") with 241 participants (78% NHW) that showed success in integrating group counseling with health information technology (HIT) to operationalize the DPP intervention in primary care. To date, very few DPP translation studies have targeted Latinos. Design: We propose to culturally adapt the IT-enhanced group DPP intervention from E-LITE and test it among Spanish-speaking or bilingual Mexican Americans who are overweight or obese and have metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes, or both. Participants (n=186) from 6 primary care practices in Santa Cruz, California (35% Latino residents; 91% of Mexican origin) will be randomly assigned to receive the culturally adapted intervention (CAI) or usual care. The primary aim is to determine the effectiveness of the CAI ("E" in the RE-AIM model). We hypothesize that the CAI will lead to a greater mean reduction in body mass index at 24 months (primary outcome) vs. usual care. Secondary outcomes will include cost-effectiveness, clinical (e.g., fasting glucose), psychosocial (e.g., quality of life), behavior change (e.g., diet, physical activity) measures. The secondary aim is to conduct a process evaluation with mixed methods for the other RE-AIM attributes: Reach (e.g., participation rate of the target population); Adoption (e.g., participating clinic and provider characteristics); Implementation (e.g., intervention fidelity); and Maintenance (e.g., sustainability in the practice setting). Implications: This health services research project (PA-13-045) falls within the AHRQ Research Portfolio areas of comparative effectiveness, HIT, and prevention and care management; it also targets a priority population. The findings will be of value to clinicians, patients, and other decision makers considering effective obesity and diabetes prevention programs for the millions of MAs who carry a disproportionate burden of these, with high potential for real-world applicability and impact on MA minority health and policies aimed to eliminate health disparities.

Abstract:	Preventing type 2 diabetes is a high priority for health care systems. Particular focus is needed on racial and ethnic minority populations who suffer disproportionately from diabetes and its complications. Success depends not only on patient access to lifestyle programs to reduce risk, but also on patient engagement in such programs. Yet evidence-based strategies to increase engagement in clinical settings are lacking. This K01 career development award will provide Susan D. Brown, PhD, with the expertise needed to achieve her long-term goal of reducing health disparities in diabetes by engaging diverse at-risk patients, such as overweight and obese women with a history of gestational diabetes, in preventive programs in health care settings. This proposal examines whether two theory-driven outreach strategies, tailored diabetes risk information and self-affirmation, impact three initial and sustained patient engagement outcomes: patient responses to outreach materials, and participation and retention in a lifestyle program. The central hypothesis is that diabetes risk information individually tailored to women's race/ethnicity and diabetes risk factors derived from electronic medical records may increase patient engagement. Yet tailored risk information can be psychologically threatening; thus its effects will be enhanced, and the threat mitigated, when individuals can affirm a sense of self-worth by actively reflecting on values that are important to them. Among overweight/obese women with a history of gestational diabetes, the specific aims are as follows. Aim 1 is to develop novel, interactive outreach materials to be used in the clinical setting containing tailored diabetes risk information and self-affirmation, in collaboration with patients and health system stakeholders. Aim 2 is to experimentally pre-test the impact of the developed outreach materials on patient responses in a 2 (tailored vs. non-tailored) x 2 (self-affirmation vs. no self-affirmation) design. Aim 3 is to experimentally pilot test the impact of interactive outreach materials on patient engagement in a health system lifestyle program, as compared to standard outreach; I will also explore effects on weight loss. This theory-based research in a real-world clinical setting will expand our limited knowledge base regarding patient engagement for diabetes prevention. Dr. Brown will benefit from the primary mentorship of Assiamira Ferrara, MD, PhD, Senior Research Scientist and Section Chief for Women's and Children's Health at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research. Complementing Dr. Brown's strengths in clinical psychology and obesity treatment, this K01 award will provide systematic training overseen by experts in diabetes and diabetes prevention (Dr. Ferrara), implementation science (Constance Weisner, DrPH, MSW and Julie Schmittdiel, PhD), health disparities (Alyce Adams, PhD), and biostatistics (Charles Quesenberry, PhD) to ensure Dr. Brown's success as an independent diabetes prevention investigator.

Abstract:	This is an application for a K08 Career Development Award for Carlos Alvarez, an assistant professor and clinical pharmacist at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Pharmacy. His long-term career goal is to be an internationally known expert and independent investigator in the pharmacoepidemiology of therapeutic agents used in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. The career development aims of this K08 application are to support training in (aim 1) pharmacoepidemiology; (aim 2) health services research; and (aim 3) analysis of large, complex national databases. This career development award will also support Dr. Alvarez's path to independence. To achieve this goal, Dr. Alvarez has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring and advisory team with significant experience in extramurally funded clinical research. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and well-known complication of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This complication often restricts providers from prescribing metformin, a glucose-lowering agent with known morbidity and mortality benefits in patients with T2DM. This FDA-labeled contraindication for metformin using arbitrary serum creatinine cut-points in patients with T2DM and CKD is not evidence-based and often necessitates prescribers to initiate or switch patients to other glucose-lowering agents with worse adverse event profiles or that have been associated with poor cardiac outcomes. Guidance in other countries does not endorse the FDA contraindication and allows for metformin use in patients with mild to moderate CKD as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate. This recommendation is also not based in evidence. Thus, the safety and effectiveness of metformin in patients with T2DM and CKD is largely unknown. Dr. Alvarez's research will focus on determining the safety and effectiveness through three specific research aims. In aim 1 he will determine patterns of metformin use in patients with T2DM and CKD. He will analyze complex administrative and clinical data from the national VA database hosted by VINCI. Patterns identified in aim 1 will inform him of the variables that should be further tested in aims 2 and 3. Aim 2 will examine associations of adverse events for metformin and other glucose-lowering agents. Specifically, he will study incident hospitalizations for lactic acidosis and primary hospitalizations or emergency department visits for hypoglycemia. In aim 3, Dr. Alvarez will assess the relationship between metformin and the development of microvascular and macrovascular outcomes. Microvascular outcomes assessed will be the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and progression of kidney disease. Macrovascular outcomes will be measured as a composite of non-fatal stroke, acute myocardial infarction, non-traumatic lower extremity amputation and cardiovascular disease death. He will also compare glycemic control between patients prescribed metformin and those on other glucose-lowering agents. Innovative techniques such as combination high-dimensional propensity score and instrumental variable modeling will be used in aims 2 and 3 to reduce bias often encountered in observational research. The research will form the basis for an R01 or equivalent application to compare metformin usage patterns, safety, and effectiveness in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease between those treated in the VA system and the United Kingdom.

Abstract:	Improving safe medication use by decreasing preventable adverse drug events (ADEs) is a fundamental priority for transforming the U.S. health care system. The "National Action Plan for ADE Prevention" (NAP) seeks to support providers, systems, and researchers in ensuring the safest care of patients by preventing ADEs from the high-priority medication classes of anticoagulants, diabetes agents, and opioids. The evidence base for how to effectively prevent or mitigate risk factors for ADEs in the outpatient setting is underdeveloped and there are limited examples of engaging patients in the safety improvement process. The proposed project is a natural evolution of medication safety (MS) research in PPRNet, an AHRQ Center for Primary Care Research and Learning at the Medical University of South Carolina, and consistent with its 15-year history of translating research into "real world" primary care practice. The project aims to, first, clarify risk factors for ADEs from high priority medications through a literature review and translate them into a working set of clinical quality measures that can be implemented in primary care; and, second, use a community-engaged action (CEA) research approach to test the impact of a refined set of preventive strategies for ADEs on practice performance on clinical quality measures in a group-randomized trial. Three significant innovations in the proposed method are 1) identification of primary care-relevant ADE risk factors for HPM and strategies to prevent them; 2) development of acceptable, reliable, and valid ADE CQMs using a modified Delphi method among primary care providers; and 3) inclusion of patients in a community-engaged action research intervention among "real world" primary care practices. PPRNet investigators and member practice communities are uniquely qualified to meet the objectives of this program announcement in order to "address the prevention of harm" and "promote standardized and idealized practices and behaviors." Outcomes from this project will address key problems in the existing outpatient safety research paradigm by engaging primary care patients, non-professional caregivers, providers, and practice staff in each aim and the multi-method plan for dissemination.

Abstract:	Approximately 1 in 3 persons with diabetes is nonadherent to their medications. Nonadherence is more common among low-income racial/ethnic minorities with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and is a strong, independent predictor of poor glycemic control, hospitalizations, mortality, and higher health care costs. Theory-based adherence promotion interventions are more effective than atheoretical, ad hoc approaches, and are needed for patients at highest risk of nonadherence. A well-validated theoretical model, the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model, has informed effective medication adherence promotion interventions for patients with HIV and hypertension, and should inform adherence interventions in diabetes. Moreover, widely available technologies, such as mobile phones, offer a means to deliver adherence interventions to a broad range of patients, including low-income racial/ethnic minorities at high risk of nonadherence. The goal of this research is to use the IMB model to inform the content and functionality of a mobile phone-delivered medication adherence promotion intervention, ensure intervention content is clearly communicated (i.e., uses simplified text and plain language), and evaluate intervention effects on adherence and glycemic control among low-income adults with T2DM receiving primary care at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). The specific aims and research strategy include (1) improving the content and functionality of an existing mobile phone-delivered medication adherence promotion to be consistent with the IMB model and clear health communication strategies, and testing for usability and acceptability with 36 patients before evaluating the intervention's effect on outcomes; (2) performing a randomized controlled trial with 500 patients at two FQHCs to test the effect of the intervention on subjective and objective measures of medication adherence, other self-care behaviors and glycemic control at 3, 6, 12, and 15 months, and to test whether the IMB mechanisms mediate intervention effects on adherence, test whether adherence mediates intervention effects on glycemic control, and test whether health literacy, numeracy, depression, and/or insulin status moderate intervention effects; and (3) developing recommendations for implementing and evaluating mobile phone-delivered interventions for low-income patients by conducting focus groups with intervention patients and clinic staff to identify the contextual influences on acceptance and effectiveness of the intervention. This interdisciplinary research will greatly enhance our understanding of how to address social-cognitive barriers to adherence among high-risk patients with diabetes, how to leverage mobile devices to support high-risk patient populations in general; and how to better design interventions to improve services for low-income racially/ethnically diverse patients, as well as other high-risk groups. Knowledge gained form this work may also inform interventions to reduce disparities in adherence, glycemic control, and other diabetes outcomes.

Abstract:	The rising epidemic of type 2 diabetes is a major cause of disability and death. With an estimated cost of $245 billion in 2012, diabetes also represents a significant burden to the U.S. health care system. Following the successful trial of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in 2002, the translation of this lifestyle intervention to community settings has been a major public health focus, with significant support from the CDC through the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP). Although the NDPP has been shown to be effective for enrolled participants, resulting in weight loss of 5-7%, independent of setting and population group, there are striking disparities in engagement. Participation rates for men are particularly low (often <30% of a class); participation rates for black and Latino men are even lower (<20%). Men generally have poorer health outcomes and lower life expectancies than women. Men of color, who are more likely than their white counterparts to face significant disadvantage, experience higher rates of diabetes-related complications, such as cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal disease. Given the disproportionate burden of diabetes and its complications for disadvantaged groups, targeted diabetes prevention programming is a crucial component of public health planning. This proposal is for a translational, cluster randomized trial of the NDPP in 16 sites for the main study, tailored to recruit, engage, and retain men from disadvantaged communities in type 2 diabetes prevention. The proposed tailored program, the NDPPB, will first be pilot tested with 30 men in 2 sites before being implemented in 8 NYC Parks and Recreation Department (REC) sites in disadvantaged communities in each of the 5 boroughs of NYC, with 8 standard NDPP REC sites for comparison. Working in collaboration with a stakeholder advisory panel of community leaders and academic experts, we will conduct focused outreach to the target population. We will implement the evidence-based NDPP curriculum, with tailoring to promote increased engagement of men. For our proposal, "engagement" encompasses recruitment, group participation, and retention. We propose having male-only coaches and groups members, adaptations to the dietary messaging, and increased emphasis on physical activity. For comparison, the standard mixed-gender groups will be implemented at eight separate REC sites, matched by NYC borough, using the standard NDPP curriculum. In the main study, we will enroll a total of 830 participants (age 18 and older) across the 16 REC sites. The specific aims of the proposed study are 1) to assess the effectiveness of the NDPPB with respect to reductions in BMI (primary outcome) compared to the standard NDPP model. We hypothesize that men engaged in the NDPPB will have reductions in BMI at 16 weeks at least equivalent to those in the standard NDPP; 2) to examine the extent to which recruitment/enrollment, intervention, and retention strategies tailored for men at risk for type 2 diabetes in disadvantaged communities are associated with improved engagement of the target population (secondary outcomes). We hypothesize that implementation of the NDPPB will proceed with more rapid recruitment and enrollment of men than in the standard NDPP; 3) to identify demographic, psychosocial, neighborhood, and REC site characteristics associated with differential recruitment and intervention effects; and 4) to provide estimates of incremental costs of the NDPPB in comparison to the standard community-based NDPP programs and relative to the primary outcome of change in BMI. Strengths of our proposal include rigorous design and analytic methodologies, with randomization by site, a participatory approach, and an adaptive process for development of our intervention with the NYC REC sites, along with a strong community and expert advisory panel. If our hypotheses are supported, this study will inform real-world implementation of the NDPP program in community settings for high-risk men and make a significant contribution to reducing the diabetes burden in these populations. Public health relevance: The public health relevance of this proposal is that although the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) has been shown to be effective in preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes for enrolled participants, there are disparities in enrollment and engagement by men, especially those from disadvantaged communities. If our hypotheses are supported, this study with its recruitment strategies and adapted curriculum will inform real-world implementation of the NDPP program in accessible community settings for men and will make a significant contribution to reducing the diabetes burden in these high-risk populations.

Abstract:	This project develops and evaluates the technical merit and feasibility of Diabetes Education and Self-Management for Intellectual Disabilities (DES-MID), a universally designed educational and prompting software application to promote diabetes knowledge retention for individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID). Education and self-management are key interventions in managing diabetes. However, due to literacy deficits and a lifelong lack of opportunities to practice self-direction, individuals with ID have not had the opportunity to utilize these key interventions. Phase I of this project integrates extensive multimedia and proven interface design techniques to develop an independently usable tool, available for iOS and Android, for students and adults with ID to become more knowledgeable regarding their diabetes and provide them with accessible, hands-on supports to become more self-directed in self-managing their health. Phase II includes further design and development of time-based and step-by-step personalized multimedia prompting and real-world prototype evaluation using key diabetes and quality-of-life indicators as outcome measures. It also includes research and development into a staff training module with both general and patient-specific information to help familiarize direct-service professionals and other advocates.

Abstract:	Diabetes mellitus affects over 25 million individuals in the United States and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. At least 1% of diabetes (>250,000 individuals) results from high penetrant single gene defects, in HNF1A, GCK, and HNF4A and several other genes. Unfortunately, as a result of phenotypic overlap with more common forms of diabetes, lack of awareness and/or techniques for identifying them among health care providers, and the cost and labor historically involved in sequencing several genes as required to make a diagnosis, the vast majority of cases of highly penetrant and genetic diabetes are misdiagnosed as type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Published evidence shows that diagnosing highly penetrant genetic forms of diabetes enables personalized treatment resulting in improved glucose control, better prediction of prognosis, and an enhanced familial risk assessment. To meet this need, we propose to implement and evaluate in four diverse health care settings our Personalized Diabetes Medicine Program (PDMP). The PDMP is currently based at the University of Maryland Center for Diabetes and Endocrinology and will be disseminated to UM Family Medicine and three partner centers: the Baltimore Veterans Administration Medical Center (BVAMC, with opportunities to disseminate nationally), Geisinger Medical Center (an integrated health system), and Bay West Endocrinology Associates (a community-based private practice group). We will also engage the community through advertisements and site visits to local primary care practices by our genetic counselor/diabetes educator team. The PDMP consists of a simple patient screening questionnaire, chart/electronic health record (EHR) review, an algorithm that utilizes questionnaire data, routine lab testing, and family history review to identify patients most likely to have highly penetrant genetic diabetes; customized multiplex gene panel sequencing of eligible patients followed by confirmation of diabetes-causal mutations in our CLIA-approved Translational Genomics Laboratory; incorporation of mutations and decision support in the EHR; genetic counseling; implementing a mutation-based treatment strategy; and family screening. Deliverables include EHR-based implementation tools, the sequencing panel and contribution of genotype/phenotype data regarding diabetes-causal variants and variants of unknown clinical significance to ClinVar and other similar public resources. We will track implementation metrics of the PDMP and conduct an impact evaluation, including evaluation of clinical outcomes as measured by changes in glycemic control in patients diagnosed with a genetic form of diabetes. Finally, we will engage a Payer Advisory Panel in the development of the impact evaluation process to enhance our ability to collect meaningful evidence to inform clinical practice recommendations and guide insurance coverage decisions as a first step to enabling diagnosis of inherited forms of diabetes across the United States and, more broadly, genomic diagnosis and treatment of highly penetrant genetic forms of other common diseases.

Abstract:	Health coaching is defined as health education, promotion, and support by a professional to enhance the well-being of individuals and support the attainment of health-related goals. However, health coaching has not been tested in the community health care setting for people living with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study is to determine whether diabetes health coaching in adults with type 2 diabetes in the community health care setting improves diabetes control, self-care behaviours, and quality of life. The implications of this study may inform health care providers towards a novel strategy to further complement and enhance support services for individuals living with type 2 diabetes.

Abstract:	South Asian patients have 50% higher rates of diabetes than the general population and a high prevalence of diabetes-related complications. Despite this burden of disease, diabetes self-management remains poor in South Asian patients. They are less likely to exercise, less likely to change their diet, and less likely to adhere to diabetes medications that are proven to reduce complications. The reasons why South Asian patients have poor diabetes management are multi-factorial, but include language, communication barriers with care providers, lack of knowledge on diabetes and its management, and fundamentally different cultural beliefs about medications and diabetes management. Previous trials of culturally tailored diabetes management programs have been unsuccessful. We believe that these studies were unsuccessful because they largely focused on language translation and did not address barriers to diabetes management that are prevalent in the South Asian community. We propose a randomized controlled trial to improve type 2 diabetes mellitus management in South Asian patients. South Asian patients with diabetes will be randomized to a culturally tailored diabetes self-management education program with peer support and integration of family. The intervention will focus on lifestyle modification and medication adherence compared to usual care with diabetes education. Patients will be enrolled from primary care clinics in the cities within the Fraser Health Authority in British Columbia, Canada. Patients and at least one family member will be randomized to the diabetes education and weekly peer sessions (individual and group) using motivational interviewing and goal setting for 3 months. The main outcome is diabetes control (i.e., A1C level). Other measures of interest include knowledge diet, exercise, and medication adherence. Diabetes is a critical health care issue for South Asian patients, and a new culturally tailored approach to diabetes management is urgently needed.

Abstract:	Our group has been working for 10 years with Northern Quebec Cree to provide scientific proof for the usefulness of Cree traditional medicine (TM) in the context of diabetes. We developed a mutually respectful, community-based, participatory research approach that includes a comprehensive research agreement protecting Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge and related intellectual property. The current project seeks to improve the safe and culturally appropriate access to Aboriginal TM by using the best of what both TM and modern healthcare systems have to offer. For this purpose, two Cree communities and one Innu community in Quebec will participate, in order to reflect various situations of primary health care delivery in an Aboriginal setting. Firstly, a review of models of "mixed care" (traditional and allopathic medicines) developed in Canada and abroad will be carried out to identify best practices. Secondly, sharing circle consultations will be organized with 1) users of health services, 2) healers and elders, and 3) health professionals and administrators, to identify the barriers, facilitators, and other factors influencing each group's perception of what is needed for safe and culturally appropriate access to TM. After the analysis of sharing circle results, all groups will then be reunited in workshops where results will be presented and discussed. Through small group discussions mingling all stakeholders, consensual solutions that satisfy all involved will then be identified. Based on an analysis of these solutions, a plan for the implementation of short-, medium- and longer term changes to primary health care will be developed and begin to be put in place in each participating community. Finally, a general model of access to Aboriginal TM will be proposed to enable it to be exported, adapted, and scaled up in Cree and Innu communities as well as other Aboriginal groups in the country.

Abstract:	Diabetes mellitus is a growing public health concern affecting roughly 7% of Canadians and projected to increase by 56% by 2018. Recent studies point to an emerging role for diabetes-related distress (DD) as a key risk factor for poor diabetes health outcomes. Compared to other well-studied comorbidities (e.g. major depression, MD), DD appears to be more strongly associated with poor disease management and may be relatively more common (18% versus 10% for MD). The relative contribution of DD versus MD in diabetes health outcomes remains unclear. Although DD is considered to be a distinct condition from MD, there is considerable symptom overlap between DD and MD, particularly with regards to somatic symptoms (e.g., feeling tired, having low energy). One potential consequence of this is high scores on a depression inventory may be indicative of high levels of DD and not necessarily MD. Additionally, the vast majority of research on this topic has been cross-sectional in nature while longitudinal studies of DD and diabetes self-management are limited. There are currently no studies assessing the predictive value of DD with regards to diabetes health outcomes in a community sample of persons with type 2 diabetes. The objectives of the proposed research are two-fold. The first objective is to develop a better understanding of the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with DD in a community-based sample of persons with type 2 diabetes. Relevant characteristics to be examined include clinical factors (anxiety, depression, and chronic conditions), lifestyle behaviors (self-care behaviors including exercise, diet, and smoking) and socio-demographic factors (age, sex, education, income). In a second step, DD and MD will be compared according to these socio-demographic and health-related characteristics. The second objective is to examine the predictive value of DD with respect to diabetes health outcomes during 2 years of available follow-up data. Indicators of diabetes-related health and disease management will include measures of physical functioning and compliance with self-care behaviors (diet, exercise, glucose monitoring, and mediation adherence). The data for this study has been collected previously and will be derived from the Evaluation of Diabetes Treatment study (EDIT). The EDIT study is a longitudinal community-based survey of Canadians living with type 2 diabetes (40-75 years of age) diagnosed within the previous 10 years. Participants were recruited via mailing lists and random digit dialing. A total of 2028 participants provided baseline data (collected in 2011) and all participants were assessed during two yearly follow-up assessments. In order to establish a causal relationship between any two variables, longitudinal analyses are of critical importance. Thus the findings from this study will help to clarify the relationship between DD and diabetes-related health behaviors. Importantly, the results from this study have a farther-reaching potential. Clinicians may consider assessing for DD as well as MD during clinical interviews so as to aid in diagnosis. Given that DD and MD are distinct conditions, improper diagnosis might entail treatment with medication or therapy that would be potentially ineffective. Finally, this study may demonstrate the need for future intervention studies aimed at developing effective treatments for DD.

Abstract:	Canada has committed to providing online, electronic health records for all Canadians. Personal health portals are online tools that will allow patients to access their own health information such as blood test results and details from hospital admissions. In 2014, Alberta will be one of the first provinces to provide personal health portals to its residents. We plan to conduct a complex and multi-dimensional evaluation to determine how well patients with a common chronic disease (diabetes) use the portal and identify possible challenges with this electronic tool in personal and clinical settings. We are working closely with the health ministry in Alberta to ensure our results lead to a more useable, effective tool for patients.

Abstract:	Disparities in health care delivery and outcomes have been linked, in part, to the difficulties physicians have in establishing effective communication with patients who differ from themselves in terms of race, ethnicity, and economic circumstances. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetic nutrition-based obesity are an important case in point. Racial and socioeconomic differences can impede doctors' ability to understand their patients' constraining realities, such as the complex tradeoffs and decision strategies involved in daily activities like purchasing food and medications. When clinical encounters about diabetes diagnosis and management are not tailored to the patient's pragmatic realities, they become less likely to lead to a shared understanding of what needs to be done. This can, in turn, lead physicians to perceive that minority patients are non-compliant and ignoring their advice. To be effective, these encounter-based discussions about care, behavior, and self-care require a dialog that is adaptive to the cultural assumptions, cognitive/emotional concerns, and systemic socioeconomic constraints of the individual patient. This area is in need of improvement--clinicians treating populations affected by health disparities must possess the competencies to understand how to frame and tailor their dialogs to the unique needs of these patients. The system we envision--Realizing Enhanced Patient Encounters through Aiding and Training (REPEAT)--will provide an innovative alternative to current (very minimal) training. It encapsulates best practices in a low-cost, ubiquitously accessible system based on experiential learning. REPEAT will offer a realistic virtual environment that allows learning to occur through simulated interactions with synthetic standardized patients (SSPs). These are interactive computer-generated avatars that can act and react realistically (via verbal and via nonverbal) to clinician communications during an office visit. Emerging cognitive simulation technology will imbue the SSPs with attributes (e.g., environmental and economic limitations, beliefs, attitudes, fears) that are representative of shared characteristics of a specific patient subpopulation. Phase I built a preliminary REPEAT prototype as a limited set of virtual clinical encounters and experimentally assessed it using a sample of graduating medical students. The assessment showed significant improvement in communication performance (using multiple measures) after only a few hours of practice in REPEAT virtual encounters as guided by REPEAT's proactive coaching, reactive feedback and other forms of tutoring. Phase II will develop a full curriculum to teach knowledge and skills needed to engage low-income African Americans with T2D or pre-diabetic obesity and productively adapt treatment plans to the socioeconomic barriers they face. Phase II will also develop commercializable software tools to create and deliver this and other REPEAT curricula. The technology has the potential to be translated to broad usage, including a version usable by patients, and to reduce health care disparities by improving communication among providers and patients.

Abstract:	American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) proposes to disseminate patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR)/comparative effectiveness research (CER) on diabetes care to a national audience of diabetes educators (DEs). DEs provide patients with instruction on self-care behaviors and promote patient compliance with recommended treatment, including medication adherence, self-monitoring, diet, exercise, and risk-reduction behaviors. DEs can assist patients in understanding treatment options and making informed health care decisions. In order to perform these roles successfully, DEs must be knowledgeable about the effectiveness of treatment options for diabetes and related conditions and competent in discussing these options with patients and within the healthcare team. AADE will initially focus on disseminating the AHRQ-produced CER on pre-mixed insulin analogues and the CER on oral medications for type 2 diabetes. AADE will evaluate the uptake of this information among DEs, including their utilization of AHRQ clinician and consumer summaries; measure change in DEs' knowledge of the comparative effectiveness of diabetes medications; and assess DEs' need for additional education on CER/PCOR. Based on this assessment, and input of a multidisciplinary PCOR advisory panel, AADE will disseminate PCOR/CER on other diabetes care topics, related conditions, and chronic disease management over the course of the three-year project. Dissemination efforts will accommodate various learning preferences of the target audience and will range from activities that utilize traditional methods (live meetings and articles in print publications) to activities that employ newer technologies (online Communities of Interest, podcasts, and blogs). AADE will provide both web-based and live continuing education to DEs on PCOR/CER. AADE will measure and report participation, satisfaction, change in knowledge, and change in competence, including DEs' self-reported change in practice. Focus groups will be utilized to gather qualitative input on DEs' application of PCOR/CER to practice. AADE will also build PCOR infrastructure within the field of diabetes education by developing guidelines and tools for translating PCOR/CER to practice for a career spectrum of DEs, ranging from entry-level workers to advanced level diabetes practitioners/clinical managers. Public health relevance: Diabetes educators provide diabetes self-management education (DSME) to persons with diabetes. The proposed project will disseminate comparative effectiveness research/patient-centered outcomes research to a multidisciplinary target audience of diabetes educators and provide instruction to diabetes educators on how to utilize the results of this type of research in their practice, advise patients on their diabetes care options, and improve quality of care. The project has the potential to impact informed decision making, quality of care, and health outcomes among persons with diabetes, a chronic disease currently impacting more than 25.8 million Americans. Full details of the project implementation plan are included in the submitted Research Strategy.

Abstract:	Over the past several years, estimates of the effects of obesity on healthcare use and expenditures have been published in the US. Few studies, however, have focused on the effects of characteristics such as body weight index (BMI) on health resource use, health expenditures, and differences in burdens among diabetes patients. In this project, we will present new estimates of the effects of individual characteristics, especially body weight index (BMI), on medication use, expenditures, and differences in financial burdens for persons with diabetes.

Abstract:	Chronic conditions, such as diabetes, account for a large share of the increase in medical spending. Controlling health care spending growth remains a high priority for policy makers. Little is known about the sources of the health care spending growth for persons with diabetes. This project will examine spending growth among persons with diabetes using the MEPS data, separating the contributions of price changes from those driven by quantity (utilization increase), and it will also examine drivers of health care cost growth.

Abstract:	Moderate-to-severe psoriasis affects 1.5 million people in the U.S. Multiple, well-designed, population-based observational studies provide convincing evidence that psoriasis is associated with 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk for cardiovascular and metabolic complications. However, the effect of immunomodulatory therapy on risk has not been adequately evaluated. Nor has risk been evaluated with respect to intermediating physiologic measures. We propose to assess the comparative effectiveness of immunomodulatory drugs used by patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis for improving body mass index, blood pressure, lipids, and fasting plasma glucose. If these physiologic measures are worsened in psoriasis but are substantially resistant to immunomodulatory therapy, then those at high risk should be identified for screening and early behavioral intervention. On the other hand, if immunomodulatory therapy for psoriasis improves or worsens these measures, then evidence is urgently needed by doctors and patients to make sound treatment decisions that balance benefits against risks and costs given the patient's personal risk profile. The drugs under study will include anti-TNF agents, methotrexate, oral retinoids, and cyclosporine. Risk on these drugs will be compared to risk on phototherapy without systemic agent. The number of patients eligible for the study is 8385, with ample numbers having exposure to the study drugs (anti-TNF, methotrexate, oral retinoids, and cyclosporine) and comparison therapy. Because the focus is on physiologic measures, the study has substantial power for subgroup analysis, with the goal of selecting patients for personalized therapy. The study will provide information that can be translated immediately and directly to the clinical setting so that doctors and patients can make the best treatment choices given the patient's underlying risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. We have estimated the potential impact of the study using conservative assumptions. If optimizing drug therapy reduces risk by even 5%, then 40,000 cases of cardiovascular disease and diabetes could be prevented. Alternatively, the study could demonstrate no benefit of anti-TNF therapy on physiologic risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes, in which case the value of anti-TNF therapy could be optimized by maintaining valid, tight prescribing indications. The study could also inform study design and future assessments of the indirect benefits of specialty pharmaceuticals. Public health relevance: People with psoriasis have elevated rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Whether the drugs used to treat psoriasis can reduce this risk is unknown. We will investigate this among 8385 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The outcomes that will be studied are body mass index, blood pressure, lipids, and fasting plasma glucose. The study results will be useful immediately and directly to doctors and patients who are making treatment decisions. The study has implications for maintaining valid, tight prescribing indications for anti-TNF therapy. The study could also inform study design and future assessments of the indirect benefits of specialty pharmaceuticals.

Abstract:	Background: Although diabetes outcomes are improving within Veterans Affairs (VA), 16% of veterans with diabetes have a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) > 9.0%. Veterans with persistent poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (PPDM)--pragmatically defined as maintenance of HbA1c > 9.0% for > 1 year despite ongoing VA diabetes care--are at high risk for complications and costs. There is an urgent need for novel approaches to PPDM that 1) can address refractory diabetes and 2) can be implemented using existing resources (without relying upon research-funded interventionists/devices). We developed Advanced Comprehensive Diabetes Care (ACDC) to address PPDM within VA. The ACDC intervention targets common barriers to improvement in PPDM by combining telemonitoring, medication management, self-management behavioral support, and depression management. Delivery of ACDC requires only existing VA clinical staff and equipment, maximizing its potential for implementation and scaling. Objectives: This pilot aimed to 1) evaluate ACDC's effectiveness, 2) utilize mixed-method formative analysis to assess ACDC's implementation strategy--use of existing VA Care Coordination Home Telehealth (CCHT) services, and 3) generate data to refine ACDC and inform broader study of its implementation. We hypothesized that ACDC would improve HbA1c, diabetes self-care, medication adherence, and depressive symptoms versus usual care. Methods: We evaluated ACDC using a type I effectiveness-implementation hybrid design. Eligible patients had PPDM as defined above; determination of PPDM required two HbA1c readings over the prior year and an established primary care/endocrinology provider at Durham VA. Exclusion criteria included inability to communicate by phone, prior hypoglycemia complications, refusal to self-monitor blood glucose, and others. Fifty veterans were randomized in an unblinded fashion to receive ACDC or usual care for 6 months. All patients continued to follow with their existing providers. ACDC patients were enrolled in the Durham VA CCHT program; all patients with poorly controlled diabetes qualify for CCHT at the Durham VA. Each ACDC patient was assigned to one of two CCHT nurses working with the study. These nurses provided patients a standard CCHT orientation and VA-approved telemonitoring equipment. ACDC comprised four phone-delivered components, administered concurrently. First, patients performed telemonitoring by collecting self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) four times daily and transmitting data to their assigned CCHT nurse. Second, patients received medication management. At two-week intervals, CCHT nurses called patients to reconcile medications and review SMBG data and medication adherence. This information was compiled into an electronic health record-based report and forwarded to the study endocrinologist, who recommended any needed medication changes via a report addendum (primary provider copied). CCHT nurses enacted any recommended changes with patients. Third, patients received self-management behavioral support. During each two-week phone encounter, CCHT nurses delivered modules addressing PPDM-relevant content (8 modules, with topics including SMBG, hypoglycemia recognition/management, proper insulin use, etc.). Fourth, if applicable, patients received depression management. Individuals endorsing depressive symptoms received a phone call from the study psychiatrist (or their existing VA psychiatrist) to arrange an expedited evaluation. Our treatment approach emphasized antidepressant pharmacotherapy proven effective in diabetes populations. All patients attended baseline, 3-month, and 6-month outcome visits; a survey was completed and lab measures obtained at each outcome visit. We used linear mixed models to analyze our primary effectiveness outcome, HbA1c. Using validated scales, we also assessed diabetes self-care, self-reported medication adherence, and depressive symptoms. Adverse events were ascertained in both randomization groups by structured self-report, and CCHT data were carefully analyzed in the ACDC group for evidence of hypoglycemia. We conducted a mixed-method formative analysis to assess ACDC and its CCHT-based implementation strategy. Intervention patients completed a quantitative acceptability measure and a phone-based semi-structured qualitative interview. We also completed qualitative interviews with both CCHT nurses to assess ACDC's implementation. Interview guides were informed by a conceptual model, and qualitative analyses followed established processes. Findings: Patients were predominantly male and majority African American. Mean age was 60, and 48% of the population had depression by ICD-9 codes or positive depression screen at baseline. Baseline diabetes control was poor (estimated mean HbA1c 10.5%). Of the 50 veterans enrolled in the study, 46 completed 6-month follow-up (23 in each group). At 6 months, estimated mean HbA1c was 9.2% for ACDC patients vs. 10.2% for usual care (estimated between-group difference -1.0%, 95% CI -2.0 to -0.0, p=0.05). Within the ACDC group, "engaged" patients (i.e., those completing 6 phone encounters, n=16) had an observed mean HbA1c of 8.3% at 6 months vs. 10.8% for "non-engaged" patients (3 encounters, n=7). ACDC patients had a significant improvement in diabetes self-care versus usual care, but self-reported medication adherence and depressive symptoms did not differ between groups. Of note, virtually every intervention patient with a positive depression screen (n=7) had existing VA psychiatry care; only one patient received expedited evaluation by the study psychiatrist (and was felt not to be depressed). Adverse events did not differ between study arms. No patients reported hypoglycemia requiring assistance. Among the 20 ACDC patients transmitting blood glucose data to CCHT, hypoglycemia was most common before the first phone encounter. Rates of hypoglycemia following encounter 1 were low (median blood glucose values < 70 =0, IQR 0-4; median blood glucose values < 60 =0, IQR 0-1). We conducted qualitative interviews with 20 ACDC patients and the two study CCHT nurses. Formative analysis is ongoing. Impact: ACDC produced a statistically and clinically significant improvement in HbA1c among veterans with PPDM; this improvement was particularly impressive for engaged patients. This improved diabetes control occurred without excessive rates of hypoglycemia or other adverse events; hypoglycemia was actually most common at study start and rarer thereafter. Veterans' improved diabetes self-care may have contributed to these observed gains. While depression was prevalent in the study population, ACDC did not impact depressive symptoms, perhaps due to high rates of preexisting psychiatry care. By definition, veterans with PPDM remain poorly controlled despite engagement with available diabetes care, and so are among the VA's highest risk diabetes patients. ACDC effectively improves control in this refractory population, so it represents a high-impact tool in VA's diabetes management arsenal. Critically, ACDC is designed for telemedicine-based delivery using only existing VA clinical infrastructure, so it is amenable to implementation and scaling. After honing ACDC through this study's formative analysis, we will study broader implementation of the intervention to maximize its impact throughout VA.

Abstract:	The American Diabetes Association has recognized collaborative goal setting between patients and their clinicians as a critical component of high-quality diabetes care. Despite this recommendation, and theoretical support as well as empirical evidence of the benefits of collaborative goal setting, little is known about what constitutes collaborative goal setting from the perspective of patients. The focus of the proposed dissertation research is to define collaborative goal setting from the patient's perspective and develop a patient-reported measure for assessing collaborative goal setting within the clinical setting. Both qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to develop the measure. The specific aims of the study are to (1) generate a list of survey items for possible inclusion in a measure of collaborative goal setting, using results from patient focus groups and input from an expert panel; and (2) administer the collaborative goal setting measure to a diverse sample of patients with diabetes and test the psychometric properties of the measure. Qualitative analyses of patient focus group results combined with input from an expert panel will identify the relevant components of collaborative goal setting and serve as the basis for the development of survey items for possible inclusion in the measure. A structured survey will then be administered to a sample of 400 patients with diabetes. Survey responses will be used to test the psychometric properties of the collaborative goal setting measure while also elucidating the relationship between collaborative goal setting and self-management skills. Structural equation modeling will be used to estimate the predictive validity coefficients. Results from the proposed study will provide a foundation upon which to measure the components of collaborative goal setting from the perspective of patients as well as foster its use in the clinical setting.

Abstract:	Pre-existing diabetes is increasingly common in pregnancy and particularly prominent in low-income minority women. It is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes for both infant and mother. Several studies have examined the association of congenital anomalies with oral anti-diabetic drug exposure; however none have looked at the independent risk of oral anti-diabetic agents on maternal morbidities. The goal of this research is to explore the relative safety of three most commonly utilized oral anti-diabetic drug classes in pregnant diabetic women (biguanide [metformin], sulfonylurea, or thiazolidinedione). With the goal to improve maternal and child health, I propose the following aims: (1) to examine annual trends in the prevalence of pre-existing diabetes in pregnant women, explore the demographic characteristics associated with pregnancy and this chronic disease state; (2) to ascertain anti-diabetic drug utilizations patterns throughout the various stages of pregnancy; and (3) to compare the safety of three drug classes of oral anti-diabetic agents (ADA) exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy in terms of risk of cesarean section deliveries, other maternal morbidities, and preterm birth. Specific comparisons will include use of metformin versus sulfonylureas as single ADA, or metformin versus sulfonylureas in combination with other oral ADAs. Data sources will include the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) database and the National Vital Birth Certificate Records (BCR) for Florida, Texas, New York, and Illinois from 1999 to 2006. This analysis will be restricted to women with Medicaid fee-for-service benefits linked to the birth certificate data. This linkage to BRCs enriches the MAX billing records with clinical parameters such as gestational age and the comprehensive medical history obtained through parent self-report. I will require 18 months continuous Medicaid eligibility, 15 months pre-delivery and 3 months post, and exclude women on insulin during the baseline period, as well as those who deliver multiplets from the inclusion into the pregnancy cohort. Proposed methods to address the two study aims include calculation of annual prevalence rates of both diabetes in pregnancy and respective anti-diabetic agent utilization, linear regression to evaluate secular trends, and multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the comparative safety of oral anti-diabetic agents in relation to cesarean section delivery, maternal morbidities and preterm birth. Common demographic variables (e.g., maternal age, education level, race/ethnicity, and geographic location) as well as clinical characteristics (e.g., hypertension, obesity, and compliance with pre-natal visits) will be used to control for confounding. The evaluation of the safety of oral anti-diabetic agents will provide better quality perinatal care, as well as contribute to future guidance on the treatment of pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy.

Abstract:	Background: Despite data showing success of shared medical appointments (SMAs) in the VA in improving diabetes care, the spread and access of these services is limited in rural areas due to lack of healthcare specialists of different disciplines and skill sets to conduct SMAs, which limits the scope of care available to veterans who reside in remote settings. This geographic barrier can be overcome by another VHA telehealth initiative, through video-clinical encounters. Thus, SMAs can be provided through the VHA-supported tools, henceforth, called video-SMAs. Objectives: The overall objective is to improve diabetes care in VA sites without local expertise through novel care delivery methods such as video-SMAs and conduct a quasi-experimental trial to evaluate the efficacy and processes of delivery of this intervention. We hypothesize that a non-physician multidisciplinary SMA care model delivered to a remote rural setting via video-conferencing would improve diabetes outcomes. Methods: A team consisting of a clinical pharmacist and a nurse practitioner from the VA Medical Center in Hawaii delivered video-SMA to a remote clinic on the island of Guam. Veterans with diabetes with hemoglobin A1c > 7% or referred by provider were enrolled into the study. The participants attended 4 weekly group sessions followed by 2 bi-monthly booster SMA visits for a total of 5 months. Each session consisted of self-management education and medication management. Patients with diabetes and A1c > 7% that had primary care visits at the same time but no vSMA intervention were selected from electronic patient records as controls. We compared changes from baseline in A1c, blood pressure, and lipid levels using mixed-effect modeling within and between the vSMA and control groups. We also analyzed differences in phone visits, unscheduled visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations between the vSMA and the control groups. Findings: Over the period of 9 months, 31 patients received video-SMA and charts of 69 controls were abstracted for a total of 100 patients in the study. Mean age was 61 +/- 8.4, and 93% were males. Sixty one percent of patients had 6-15 years duration of diabetes and 13% of patients had diabetes for greater than 15 years. Over the 5-month period, the intervention video-SMA group showed a significant decline in A1c vs. the control group (9.1+/-1.9 to 8.3+/-1.8 vs. 8.6+/-1.4 to 8.7+/-1.6, respectively, p=0.03). No significant changes over time in blood pressure or lipid levels were found between the vSMA versus the control group. Although changes were not statistically significant, the video-SMA group had a trend towards fewer unscheduled outpatient visits (0.28 vs. 0.26 visits), ER visits (0.06 vs. 0.03 visits), and hospitalizations (0.04 vs. 0.03) compared to controls. In conclusion, the SMA model appeared to improve diabetes outcomes with potential to reduce healthcare utilization in a rural setting. Impact: The challenges of healthcare delivery in rural areas are social and geographic isolation, limited access to multidisciplinary expertise for patients, and lack of decision support and interprofessional exchange for the local health providers. This proposed quality initiative attempts to target the above obstacles using advanced video-conferencing system in the CBOCs with telemedicine capabilities. Thus, aside from improvement in access to SMAs in diabetes and its potential benefits, local providers and participants of the video-SMA will also have increased interaction with off-site experts in diabetes care and decision support in the co-management of these patients.

Abstract:	The treatment program for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Rwanda is highly successful, with national HIV treatment services available to 90% of the population eligible for combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). As Rwanda strives to become a middle-income country, it is undergoing rapid transition to development with an increasing aging population, urbanization, and potential higher rates of obesity, and it will potentially be affected by two separate epidemics of noncommunicable diseases and the effects of HIV and ART treatment. Although data are limited on metabolic, cardiovascular, and diabetes complications associated with HIV infection and treatment with cART, the country's disease burden is gradually increasing due to the burden of HIV- and cART-associated metabolic, cardiovascular, and diabetes complications. In this planning research training program, our goal is to strengthen inter-institutional research training partnerships for our institutions of Women's Equity in Access to Care and Treatment (WE-ACTx Rwanda) (applicant institution), King Faisal Hospital (KFH), Kigali, and National University of Rwanda to collaborate with Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University to leverage research capacity for Rwandans to address emerging HIV- and cART-associated metabolic, diabetes, and cardiovascular complications including the recently described entity of "malnutrition" diabetes which is unstudied in the presence of HIV infection and cART use. Our second goal is to enable Rwandan applicants and their Einstein collaborators to solidify relationships, assess scientific and infrastructure needs required to implement relevant research training program, identify potential trainees and the necessary staff development in Rwanda to apply and implement a successful five-year HIV Research Training Program (HRTP) after a two-year planning period. We envisage carrying out the following: 1) assessing availability and gaps for scientific research training needs and infrastructure in Rwanda that will be required to implement the five-year HRTP; 2) carrying out interactive teleconference presentations by Einstein faculty using KFH, K Telemedicine facilities on HIV- and ART-cardiovascular, diabetes, and metabolic complications; 3) visiting of Einstein faculty's research sites and training facilities by Rwandan trainees in order to study and appreciate various research training settings and programs to plan relevant research training for the future five-year HRTP; and 4) developing an application for the five-year HRTP that will include short-term and long-term training programs. These activities will leverage the Government of Rwanda (GoR) and Ministry of Health (MoH) mission to improve availability and capacity of Rwandan scientists and clinicians, and to reinforce institutional capacity. Thus, these planning grant activities will contribute to greater understanding of the requirements for research training to foster strong and coherent Einstein-Rwandan institutional collaborations.

Abstract:	Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of diabetes treatment. Severe hypoglycemia is more frequent in older adults than their younger counterparts and is associated with increased risk of falls, fractures, dementia, cardiovascular events, mortality, and poor quality of life. Diabetes care quality metrics focus almost exclusively on prevention of hyperglycemia and its complications and reward target-based glucose lowering--this can potentially lead to one-size-fits-all clinical practice and an increase in adverse events. Recent clinical guidelines call for individualized goal-setting in diabetes care, but data on how to personalize care to maximize benefits and minimize adverse events are lacking. A clear and comprehensive understanding of the burden of hypoglycemia on patients and a rigorous examination of risk factors for hypoglycemia are required to inform treatment decisions in older persons with diabetes, assess an important aspect of current quality of care, and provide future targets for intervention that may mitigate the burden of hypoglycemia. The candidate's career goal is to become an independent clinical investigator in the field of diabetes and geriatrics, generating knowledge to help guide personalized diabetes treatment. In this proposal, the candidate will apply rigorous epidemiologic, biostatistical, and qualitative research methods to evaluate older patients who experience severe hypoglycemia, identify potential contributors to hypoglycemia admissions, and examine the relationship between specific glucose targets, glucose-lowering therapies and hypoglycemic events in order to provide better information on treatment-related adverse events and improve clinical outcomes. Specific aim 1 is to characterize recent trends in hospital admissions for hypoglycemia among older Medicare recipients with diabetes for a 12-year period from 1998-2010, and to examine race, gender, and geographic differences in these trends. Specific aim 2 is to elucidate factors that may contribute to the risk of hospitalization for hypoglycemia among a sample of older adults with diabetes, using qualitative methods. Specific aim 3 is to evaluate the association between glycemic control, glucose-lowering agents, and hypoglycemic events in the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE), a multiethnic cohort of 20,000 patients with diabetes in a large integrated health care delivery system. The combination of a large-scale surveillance approach, primary data collection to investigate potential reasons for hypoglycemia hospital admissions, and a detailed analysis of a clinical registry will provide the candidate with additional skills in large database analyses, qualitative research methods, and epidemiologic aging research--and will lead to future work to comprehensively understand the balance of risks and benefits of glucose-lowering therapy in older adults.

Abstract:	Background: Diabetes is estimated to affect up to 1 in 5 VA patients overall and up to 1 in 4 racial/ethnic minority patients. Patients with low health literacy and minority groups have more difficulty communicating with physicians, report lower adherence to physicians' recommendations, and have higher rates of poor diabetes outcomes. Activating patients to use more effective communication with physicians can lead to better adherence to treatment and to better biomedical outcomes. In this project we build upon our prior work from two HSRD-funded pilot projects to improve doctor patient communication in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In a previously funded short-term project, SHP-08-182, we conducted focus groups with patients with T2DM to elicit and understand, from the patient perspective, barriers to communicating with their physician. This qualitative work was used in a subsequent pilot project, PPO-08-402 to refine and pilot test an educational video to encourage patients to use active participatory communication in their visits to physicians. This work was successfully completed and the product is a 10-minute video titled "Speak Up!" that in testing was found to be acceptable to patients and feasible for patients to view immediately preceding their medical encounter. Objectives: In this project (ACTIVet) we tested the effectiveness of the video (Speak Up!) as an intervention to improve patients' communication. Our primary aim is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of an intervention testing whether the intervention increases patients' active participatory communication behaviors, patients' post-visit ratings of self-efficacy to communicate, medication adherence, and diabetic control (HgbA1c). There are four secondary aims which include assessments of the (1) mediators, and (2) moderators of the relationship of the intervention condition to outcomes, (3) costs of the intervention, and (4) an evaluation of the feasibility of using the video for pre-visit preparation. Methods: We conducted a two-group, pre-post, randomized controlled, single site trial of the Speak Up! intervention video in patients with T2DM. We screened 794 patients and consented 176 patients (excluding 7 who moved to another facility or to a non-participating PCP. We randomly assigned 169 patients with 77 allocated to and 64 received the intervention and 92 allocated to and 83 received the allocated control. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Patients were seen at pre- and post-intervention visit by one of 21 primary care providers. Patients were randomized to view a 10-minute intervention or control video prior to their second visit. Visits were audio recorded. Analysis of the audio recordings is ongoing. Audio recordings are analyzed for patients' and physicians' communication behaviors. Self-efficacy to communicate was collected by self-report. Adherence was collected by self-report and by medication possession ratio. Diabetic control was collected by chart review. Analyses examined the relationship of the intervention condition to outcomes, mediators, and moderators of that relationship, and will estimate costs of the intervention and feasibility of using the video in a busy clinic. Findings: There were no statistically significant differences in age, race, gender, education, marital status, income, health literacy, quality of life, trust in physician, or the other covariates measured between the control and intervention groups (P>0.10). In bivariate analysis (n=147), self-efficacy at visit 1 among intervention and control was not statistically different (P=0.94), but at visit 2 self-efficacy was somewhat higher (P=0.07) in the intervention compared with the controls. After adjusting for baseline self-efficacy score using multiple regression, patients in the intervention group had higher self-efficacy compared with the control group (Beta 0.71 [SE 0.32]; P=0.03). Mean A1c was 9.7% before visit 1 and 9.1% after visit 2. In mixed regression analyses using A1c values from 4 weeks to one year after visit 2, the A1c decreased 0.6% more in the intervention than the control group P=0.02. Impact: VA transformation efforts, including interprofessional Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT), are focusing attention on patient-centered care. Improved communication is a central feature of patient-centered care. Communication in medical interactions is critical and plays an important, but often overlooked, role in health care decision making and quality of care. Patients who have difficulty communicating are less involved in consultations with their physicians, receive less information and support, and are less satisfied with their care. In turn, these patients may not understand their treatment options, may have less knowledge, less positive beliefs about treatment, and less trust in physicians, and may experience poorer health outcomes. Teaching patients to communicate more effectively is patient-centered because it inherently supports a patient-driven approach to delivering health care. Our intervention is designed to encourage patients' active communication. Improving patients' communication is a unique focus that may supplement and add to the VA efforts in areas such as the Patient Aligned Care Team. In addition, the methodology is not disease-specific and may be a paradigm for improvement in other conditions. The "Speak Up" (intervention) video developed for this study was mentioned in an article by Dr. Gordon in the May 2015 issue of VA HSRD FORUM. The "Speak Up" video developed for this study is being used as part of new patient orientation at the CBOC in Crown Point, Indiana. An informal survey indicated that this use was well received by the veterans. The "Speak Up" video developed for this study is now incorporated into the intervention of another VA project ("Point of care Health Literacy and Activation Information to improve diabetes care" HSRD Project #12 426 PI Woodard). "Speak Up" is used to assist patients communicate with their physicians/providers about their personalized goal setting. Preliminary results suggest that the brief pre-visit video intervention (Speak Up!) improved diabetes patients' self-efficacy in interacting with their physicians and led to improvement in diabetic control.

Abstract:	Interventions to assist patients in chronic illness self-management are needed to eliminate barriers to health care; accommodate limited health literacy; provide sustainable, cost-effective patient education and support; and move beyond ineffective, non-interactive health behavior interventions. Advances in communication technology such as the Web 2.0 are a means to fill these needs. Virtual environments (VE) promote social interaction and learning via application and feedback, leading to superior learning and skill set transfer. We propose to test a theoretically grounded, technologically based, bio-behavioral intervention using a VE to facilitate self-management of diabetes. Diabetes affects 23.6 million U.S. adults, most of whom have type 2 diabetes (T2D) (NIDDK, 2009). Metabolic control is known to reduce diabetes morbidity and mortality, yet it remains a leading cause of death in the U.S. Individuals with T2D provide a majority of their own care, making diabetes self-management (DSM) (e.g. diet, exercise) integral to control. Tailored DSM interventions utilizing patient-provider interaction have had encouraging short-term effects. However, this frequent interaction is unattainable and costly. Internet interventions have the potential to capture the dynamics of patient-provider interaction, but to date remain "flat" with asynchronous communication. VEs are a potential solution to capture patient-provider dynamics via interactivity, synchronous communication, knowledge application, and social networking in an immersive environment. Preliminary findings from our R21 (R21LM010727-01) showed that a virtual diabetes community with real-time interaction among adults with T2D, and with health care professionals is feasible and has the potential to influence metabolic control and psychosocial mediators. Thus we are proposing a randomized controlled trial to determine whether the effects of participation in a VE that incorporates real-time diabetes self-management training and support (DSMT/S) will be associated with positive changes in health behaviors. The LIVE community will consist of a community center, gym, grocery store, and other locations, each allowing for interactive knowledge application. Based on this design our primary aim is to (1) determine the effects of providing DSMT/S in a VE on diet and physical activity behavior change in adults with T2D compared to traditional DSMT/S over 12 months. Our secondary aims are (2) to determine the effects on metabolic outcomes; (3) to assess whether level of engagement and social network formation in LIVE differentially impacts behavioral outcomes; and (4) to examine the potential mediating effects of changes in self-efficacy; diabetes knowledge, diabetes-related distress and social support on behavior change and metabolic outcomes. Should LIVE prove effective in improved self-management of diabetes, similar interventions could be applied to other prevalent chronic diseases. Innovative programs such as LIVE have potential for improving health care access in an easily disseminated alternative model of care that potentially improves the reach of DSMT/S.

Abstract:	Despite the high prevalence, morbidity and mortality burden of chronic medical conditions among persons with serious mental illness (SMI), few quality measurement protocols provide guidance on the optimal care of these complex patients. Guidelines have generally been developed for the simplest case--a person with only one disease--and it is not clear whether interventions are equally effective in complex populations with multiple medical and behavioral health co-morbidities, socioeconomic disparities, or inequities in access to care. There remain substantial gaps in our knowledge about which interventions hold greatest promise for improving the overall health of populations with SMI and co-morbid medical disease; what system re-design will be most effective in delivering those interventions; or how treatments for mental illness (e.g. antipsychotics) may modify outcomes for medical conditions (e.g. diabetes). Maine has undertaken significant integrated care initiatives to improve physical and behavioral health outcomes for persons with SMI, including the statewide implementation in 2013 of Medicaid Health Homes in mental health agencies (HHOPES) that will provide comprehensive care management and chronic disease self-management support for consumers with diabetes. In addition to HHOPES implementation, Maine's mental health system is planning an antipsychotic quality improvement project designed to reduce the onset and burden of diabetes in the SMI population. This proposed NIMH project will take advantage of Maine's service delivery innovations to develop the research design and infrastructure necessary to support and evaluate the outcomes of these natural experiments. Products will include a person-specific dataset linked from multiple data sources; advances in the development of standardized metrics and procedures for analysis of Medicaid, Medicare, vital statistics, and clinical data; and process data on the challenges to implementing these models. In achieving these outcomes, this project will expand knowledge about best practices for improving health outcomes of persons with SMI. Relevance: Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) are at high risk of developing diabetes, and when they do, have poorer outcomes than the general diabetic population. This study will explore health system innovations designed to improve diabetes care management for persons with SMI, and develop the research infrastructure needed to study their impact.

Abstract:	Treatment adherence in type 1 diabetes (T1D) tends to decline among adolescents, increasing risks of acute and chronic complications, excess health care use, poorer quality of life, and T1D-related family conflict. Poor adherence is associated with psychiatric and family dysfunction and often persists into early adulthood. Therapeutic advances such as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII or insulin pump) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) could improve metabolic control and quality of life. But teens often do not benefit fully from such advances. Many studies of adults show that patient-centered communication styles predict more favorable clinical outcomes. Shared medical decision making (SMDM) interventions have improved outcomes among adults with diabetes and other conditions. Research in pediatrics has also shown that patient-centered and family-centered communication styles predict favorable outcomes, but most of this research is in primary care and has not studied youth with chronic conditions. Because there have been no controlled trials of SMDM with chronically ill youths, we propose a randomized controlled trial of an SMDM intervention compared with usual clinical practice (UCP). Qualitative interviews of youths and parents who have previously faced these decisions and reliance on expert consultants, pediatric endocrinologists, and diabetes educators will precede the trial and provide valued input for refining the planned intervention and adapting the structured SMDM format for pediatrics. Then, 120 youths aged 11 to 17 years with T1D who are candidates for CSII or CGM (and a parent/caregiver) will be recruited and randomized at four sites. The SMDM intervention will be delivered via iPad, facilitated by a certified diabetes educator (CDE) in a standardized, yet individually tailored format. SMDM will employ multimedia decision aids prepared with the award-winning Nemours Center for Children's Health Media in accordance with pertinent international standards for delivery via iPad. SMDM will also include individualized assistance from the CDE in assuring that each youth's and parent's preferences, values, and cultural beliefs are carefully addressed. After a baseline evaluation and randomization to SMDM or UCP, effects on the primary outcome (treatment adherence, device utilization) and secondary outcomes (glycemic control, treatment alliance, decision conflict and regret, treatment satisfaction, diabetes-related distress, and self-efficacy) will be measured over one year. Mixed effects modeling will be the primary analytical technique for evaluating effects on primary/secondary outcomes, examining selected variables as moderators and mediators of treatment effects, and assessing whether such effects are comparable for the three medical decisions of interest. The results will verify whether SMDM in this context enhances treatment adherence, device use, and parent/patient-reported outcomes in youth with T1D.

Abstract:	The global increase in the number of people with diabetes, together with the cost of complications, is a serious challenge to health care delivery. Patients with diabetes face serious complications due to a lack of self-management skills. Specifically, patients treated with oral medications do not have the personalized tools needed to track their daily diabetes management. We believe that the effective management of patients with diabetes requires a system to modify their behaviour by relating blood glucose readings to their diet, physical activity, weight, and the use of their medication, providing them with the means to understand how their lifestyle affects their blood glucose control. Mobile phones are a logical way of delivering this because they are widely used and promote greater access to care. Although there are many diabetes-related mobile phone and web tools in development, the majority of them require a health care provider for feedback and do not generally focus on behaviour change or self-care. We believe that automated feedback delivered through the mobile application will be as impactful, less resource-intensive, and in the end more cost-effective. The mobile application will also use real incentives to motivate patients to perform self-care activities. In order to test the effectiveness of the intervention, we propose a 12-month randomized controlled trial of 150 patients. Patients will be assigned to either (1) the control group receiving usual care, or (2) the group using the mobile phone system with usual care. The system consists of an iPhone preloaded with the mobile application, and an activity monitor, a weight scale, and a glucometer, all of which communicate wirelessly with the mobile phone. The system will enable patients to track behaviour, gain actionable-knowledge, and receive personalized feedback, ultimately resulting in effective self-care, prevention of complications, and improvement in quality of life.

Abstract:	About 3 million Canadians live with diabetes that is associated with serious complications and enormous economic burden, both of which are preventable through proper diabetes management. Psychosocial and lifestyle factors along with proper control of blood sugar are vital in diabetes management. Psychosocial support and behavior change are important strategies for chronic disease management, and in case of diabetes, the application of these strategies can help patient compliance with their therapies and lifestyle choices. This research project aims to use e-health technologies to empower patients to achieve self-efficacy in managing their diabetes in a home setting. The project will develop patient-centered interventions that will provide personalized behavior change strategies to diabetic patients to help them increase their knowledge and skills in self-management of diabetes. We will develop a mobile app that will proactively deliver educational and motivational messages to patients over their smart phone (or tablets) in order to help them manage their diabetes. For care providers, especially family physicians, we will develop a web-based decision support system that will help them administer evidence-based behavior change strategies for their diabetic patients. In summary, the project will offer a unique e-health framework to incorporate behavior change models to provide personalized self-management support to diabetic patients.

Abstract:	Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the U.S. Although many people with diabetes develop DKD, approximately one in five has DKD with uncontrolled hypertension that increases their risk of ESRD, cardiovascular events, and death. These risks are likely reduced by simultaneously improving control of multiple risk factors. However, prior interventions have largely been conducted using costly face-to-face visits that limit widespread application and including homogenous international populations that limit generalizability to diverse U.S. patients. In addition, these studies have been mostly tested in early or late DKD but have not targeted those with moderate DKD. Targeting this group with DKD and uncontrolled hypertension provides a window of opportunity to potentially optimize efficiency and impact by excluding those with stable disease and reducing the risks of ESRD, cardiovascular events, and death before developing advanced DKD. We propose an innovative telehealth approach that has reduced antecedents of kidney disease, including poor blood pressure control, but has never been used to treat DKD. The Simultaneous risk factor control using Telehealth to slOw Progression of Diabetic Kidney Disease (STOP-DKD) Study is a 3-year randomized, controlled trial in 300 adults with moderate DKD and uncontrolled hypertension that will evaluate whether a multifactorial telehealth intervention reduces progression of DKD compared to an education control. A study pharmacist will deliver the intervention via monthly telephone calls that simultaneously address medication management and modify multiple risk factors through a combination of patient self-monitoring, behavioral therapies, and education that optimizes adherence and self-efficacy. The primary outcome is change in estimated glomerular filtration rate after three years. Secondary outcomes include change in blood pressure, blood glucose, and urinary albumin excretion. Other analyses will evaluate differences in clinical endpoints (doubling of creatinine, dialysis, death, cardiovascular events, and composite), improved behaviors that affect hypertension control (medication adherence, diet, physical activity, weight control), and cardiovascular risks (lipid profiles, aspirin use, smoking cessation). We will also conduct cost-effectiveness analyses using a robust simulation model. To mitigate the growing burden of DKD in the U.S., these studies are designed to determine whether a potentially scalable, telehealth intervention effectively slows progression of DKD in a diverse, high-risk population and whether it is also cost-effective.

Abstract:	Asians and Pacific Islanders as a whole bear a disproportionate burden of diabetes, both in terms of higher prevalence and rates of diabetes-related complications. Asian and Pacific Islander populations are the fastest growing populations in the United States (U.S.), increasing by 43 percent and 35 percent respectively during the past decade. Despite obvious and important differences among Asian and Pacific Islander subgroups, the relatively small size of these populations included in diabetes studies has resulted in the "lumping" of these heterogeneous populations of Asian groups and Pacific Islanders in diabetes studies, masking potentially important differences. The study of these groups is also complicated by a relatively high proportion of individuals with mixed race/ethnicity. As a consequence, little is known about diabetes prevalence, treatment patterns and outcomes among Asian and Pacific Islander (API) populations, or importantly, about underlying factors contributing to differences among these populations. Diabetes prevalence, and particularly outcomes, is influenced by many individual, treatment, and environmental factors. The objective of this study is to utilize electronic medical record (EMR) data, patient survey data, and geocoded census data to comprehensively assess differences in diabetes prevalence, intermediate clinical outcomes and prevalence of diabetes-related complications among ten well-defined populations in a large integrated health care system in Hawaii. The ten populations studied will include Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiians, Samoans, mixed Asian+Caucasian, mixed Asian+Hawaiian, mixed Hawaiian and Caucasian, and mixed Asian+Hawaiian+Caucasian. A Caucasian-only group will also be included for purposes of comparison. The study will focus on a series of variables known to be important influences in diabetes prevalence and outcomes in each of three broad domains: individual factors, treatment factors, and environmental factors. The specific aims of the study are to 1. describe differences in diabetes prevalence, intermediate clinical outcomes, and complications among these Asian and Pacific Islander populations; and 2. identify the most important contributing factors to observed differences among these populations within a series of individual, treatment, and environmental factors. The results of this study will provide important information about the underlying causes of disparities among a rapidly growing segment of the U.S. population, with findings potentially relevant to other minority populations, and have practical utility in the strategic design of targeted interventions to achieve optimal outcomes for diabetes among Asian and Pacific Islander populations.

Abstract:	Background: Multiple large-scale randomized controlled trials have shown that in people with impaired glucose tolerance, 40-60% of type 2 diabetes cases can be prevented with lifestyles interventions that emphasize diet, exercise, and weight loss. Despite the strong evidence base supporting preventability, the incidence of diabetes continues to increase. VA MOVE! does not specifically target those with pre-diabetes. Most veterans referred to VA MOVE! who do not already have a diagnosis of diabetes do not know if they are pre-diabetic. With a few exceptions, lifestyle modification interventions that target individuals with pre-diabetes and follow the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) curriculum are not available to veterans with pre-diabetes in the VA. This project builds on two concurrent projects, the VA Diabetes Prevention clinical demonstration project funded by our partners at VA National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP) and the QUERI funded RRP titled: VA Diabetes Prevention: Epidemiology of Pre-Diabetes and Implementation Pilot. Objectives: The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide our clinical partner, NCP, with evidence to guide future implementation of diabetes prevention strategies in the VA. The specific aims of this study are to (1) test an implementation strategy and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the VA-DPP demonstration project at three VA medical centers using a mixed-methods approach that is informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) frameworks; (2) test for mediation of intervention effect on weight loss by constructs that are addressed differently in VA MOVE! and VA-DPP including group cohesion, intervention intensity, outcome expectations, goal awareness and commitment, and self-regulation skills; and (3) conduct cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses of implementing the VA-DPP broadly in the VA from the perspective of the health system. Methods: This was a hybrid type 3 mixed-methods implementation evaluation project. Veterans referred to the VA MOVE! program at three VA medical centers were screened for the VA-DPP clinical demonstration project between August 2012 and January 2014. Veterans who had a HbA1c of 5.7-6.4 or a fasting plasma glucose of 100-125ml, lived within 60 minutes of the VAMC, and met additional inclusion criteria were assigned to the VA-DPP or MOVE! program using a systematic sampling approach. Participants were invited to complete surveys at baseline and 12 months. Medical records data were used to evaluate participation and health outcomes, and conduct a cost-effectiveness analyses. Qualitative data were elicited through interviews with a subset of participants. Additionally, staff interviews pre- and post-implementation were conducted and coded using the CFIR and RE-AIM implementation framework to inform implementation and to guide development of implementation strategies for future dissemination. A total of 1850 patients were screened and/or attended a MOVE! orientation session at one of three VAMCs and were assessed for eligibility. Among these, 387 individuals met all eligibility criteria; 273 were assigned to the VA-DPP program and 114 were assigned to the MOVE! program. Among the 273 participants assigned to VA-DPP, 36% (n=98) explicitly declined to participate. However, our weight analyses at 6 and 12 months included all VA-DPP assigned participants consistent with an intent-to-treat (ITT) analytic approach. One patient who did not have a baseline weight assessment was excluded, leaving a final analytic weight sample of 386 participants (VA-DPP n=273, MOVE! n=113). For HbA1c outcomes assessment, patients were excluded who did not have a baseline HbA1c or FPG within six months of enrollment (n=6) and participants who did not complete a follow-up HbA1c test (n=71), leaving a final analytic HgA1c sample of 310 participants (VA-DPP n=210, MOVE! n=100). Findings: Participants were mostly middle-aged with an average HbA1c of 6.0% and co-morbid hypertension. All baseline characteristics were comparable between study arms except for race/ethnicity. MOVE! program participants had a higher percentage of Hispanics and lower proportions of African Americans and Caucasians (p=0.04). Participants were representative of the VHA population (overweight/obese males) and also reflected the racial/ethnic diversity at the three VAMCs included in this trial. Participation rates were higher in the VA-DPP program over the 12 months. In the first 6 months, 88.3% of VA-DPP participants and 84% of MOVE! participants completed at least one session of their respective program and 55.0% and 42.4%, respectively, completed at least four sessions. Based on adjusted outcomes within groups, participants in the VA-DPP had statistically significant weight loss at 6 and 12 months but MOVE! program participants did not. There were significant differences in predicted weight change between arms at 6 months (MOVE! -1.9 kg vs. VA-DPP -4.1kg, p<0.001) but not at 12 months (MOVE! -2.0 vs. VA-DPP -3.4kg, p=0.16). After controlling for covariates, HbA1c at 12 months did not show significant changes from baseline, and no difference was found in the predicted HbA1c change at 12 months by study arm (MOVE! 0.06 vs. VA-DPP -0.02, p=0.34). The quality of coaching, reflected by fidelity ratings for coach characteristics, was rated highly for both programs. However, VA-DPP had higher fidelity ratings for four domains of program delivery. Thus, though session leaders for both programs tended to come "prepared and organized," the programs differed in many other ways, e.g., more "positive relationships among the group members" in VA-DPP than MOVE!. Additionally, VA-DPP participants reported higher satisfaction for six of eight items related to their program. Together, these differences may partially explain weight loss differences, and perhaps more importantly the higher rates of continued engagement of VA-DPP participants. Multi-faceted strategies are needed to successfully reach targeted patients and to implement and maintain the DPP in a clinical setting. Impact: Implementation of the VA-DPP demonstration program has the potential to significantly improve health outcomes for veterans by delaying or preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes. The research component of the VA-DPP contributed to our knowledge about the incidence of pre-diabetes in veterans; their attitudes and beliefs about diet, exercise, and weight loss; and understanding how different programs may impact weight loss. Preliminary VA-DPP data provided important and relevant information to NCP who updated MOVE! group visit guidance to align more closely with the DPP's curriculum for all veterans, not just those with pre-diabetes. This work, along with other projects, also helped lead to our newly funded MOVE! LEAP project as part of our new PRoVE QUERI program.

Abstract:	Patients with type 2 diabetes are increasingly living with multiple concurrent conditions and complicated medical regimens. For these patients, diabetes management decisions and treatment goals must be addressed within the larger context of other competing health concerns. In parallel, clinical advances have led to a substantial increase in the number of tasks that primary care providers must perform during each visit. These twin trends of patient and visit complexity present a formidable challenge to effective diabetes primary care. Although there are a variety of non-visit strategies that can and are being instituted to address these issues, the primary care visit remains a vital opportunity for catalyzing changes in diabetes care. To achieve this change, efficient and scalable tools to support more productive primary care encounters are needed. We hypothesize that among patients with type 2 diabetes and elevated HbA1c, a systematic approach that enables patients to explicitly prioritize their top diabetes and non-diabetes-related health concerns before the primary care visit will result in more effective diabetes care over time. To test this hypothesis, our proposal's aims are to 1) design and implement a web-based tool linked to the electronic medical record that will enable complex patients to indicate, and primary care physicians (PCPs) to review, patients' top health priorities for their upcoming visit; 2) conduct a randomized clinical trial among patients with type 2 diabetes and elevated HbA1c testing the impact on intermediate care outcomes (medication adherence, medication intensification) compared to usual care and HbA1c (primary clinical outcome), blood pressure, and lipid control (secondary clinical outcomes) compared to usual care; and 3) among a subset of intervention participants (patients and PCPs), use mixed qualitative and quantitative methods to examine the impact of pre-visit prioritization on the content of subsequent visit discussions and examine the influence of patient and PCP factors on these discussions. The key conceptual innovation of this study is to test a replicable, low-cost approach to improving diabetes primary care that explicitly integrates non-diabetes problems into the process of diabetes management. We will implement an easy-to-use web-based tool linked to our EPIC(R)-based electronic medical record. This patient-centered care model has the potential to significantly improve the design of primary care systems responsible for providing patient-centered care and offers an innovative approach to improving the care of increasingly complex patients with type 2 diabetes. This study addresses the three NIH priorities of translating evidence into practice, improving medication adherence, and understanding health care disparities. If successful, we will work to actively disseminate the tool throughout our system and to other U.S. care organizations.

Abstract:	Management of type 1 diabetes requires vigilant monitoring by patients who often encounter numerous barriers that can impede proper management. Barriers can include educational, psychosocial, and support issues. Polaris Health Directions, a small business, and University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing have partnered to develop the technology-enabled Type 1 Diabetes Education and Support (T1DES) system that will assist and support diabetes management by providing (1) an automated, web-based management assessment (skills, knowledge, barriers, routine screenings for complications) that can be completed on any internet-connected personal or tablet computer; (2) real-time patient report with tailored educational materials and support; (3) real-time one-page clinician report that highlights psychosocial issues, barriers to management, and need for routine screening; (4) e-learning tools (web-based learning modules and webinars); (5) enhanced messaging systems (EMS; i.e., automated text messaging and emails) to send patient reminders and to support diabetes management between office visits; and (6) the capability to be integrated into electronic health records (EHR) via HL7 interface and automate referrals to mental health providers, social workers, and diabetes specialists. In phase I, a pilot study will be conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of T1DES to support diabetes management through e-assessment, e-learning, and e-messaging. Specific aim 1 is to develop the T1DES prototype based on end-user interviews (patient, family members, diabetes providers); finalize educational modules and e-messaging content; design assessment and reports; write and test T1DES software; train clinicians to use the system, and conduct a Field Test at the Diabetes Center for Children at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (months 1-6). Specific aim 2 is to conduct a pilot study and evaluate the acceptance of the system by end-users (months 6-12). The pilot study will enroll 40 patients (13-18 years old) and 40 family members involved in the patient's diabetes management. Patients will complete the assessment, set goals to achieve before their next appointment, and receive a tailored, educational feedback report that will be reviewed with a diabetes provider. The patient will then receive e-messages daily for three months based on the diabetes management goals they have selected. Additionally, family members and patients will receive appointment reminders and have access to online e-learning tools (educational modules and webinars). Three months after enrolling in the study, participants will be asked to complete a satisfaction survey regarding the educational and supportive benefits of the T1DES system, readability, and ease of use that will help inform further product development. In phase II, a multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted to examine T1DES impact on HbA1C, management skills, knowledge, and barriers, medical outcomes, and health care utilization over a one-year period. Other phase II goals will include integration with EHR, development of a web-based multimedia training for clinicians, and interactive provider-patient text and voice messaging.

Abstract:	Approximately 32% of Medicare spending is attributed to diabetic populations, and the prevalence of diabetes is growing at an alarming rate. Approximately 79 million Americans have prediabetes. The landmark 2002 Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) demonstrated that lifestyle modification is a successful approach to preventing diabetes. The DPP lifestyle changes reduced the risk of developing diabetes in patients with prediabetes by 58% at three years following the intervention. The DPP involved a curriculum of 16 lessons delivered one-on-one over 6 months and a follow-up maintenance program over the remaining year. While the DPP lifestyle modification program was overwhelmingly successful, its widespread implementation necessitates the development of cost-effective delivery channels. While the NIH and UnitedHealth Group have invested in a pilot program to adapt the curriculum to a group format delivered at the YMCA, alternatives that are scalable and accessible are necessary to make the DPP available across a broader segment of society. Omada Health is developing an interactive DPP curriculum from the recently released CDC DPP curriculum; this curriculum is designed to be delivered on a user-friendly web-based platform that Omada Health has built for virtual small groups. The goal of this proposal is to enhance the basic DPP curriculum with interactive and tailored components to motivate and engage users, increase participation, and improve health outcomes. Research into specific elements of online behavior interventions has demonstrated that interactive features, such as personalized email contact and bulletin board participation, may improve user outcomes. Upon completion of these specific aims, Omada Health will conduct large pilot studies and commercialize the web-based DPP curriculum and platform through strategic partnerships. Omada Health's online distribution model makes this diabetes prevention program ideal for rapid, nationwide expansion. Not only is this solution scalable, but it is more convenient and accessible for individuals with limited time and does not depend on access to a particular geographic location or vendor. Thus, Omada Health's interactive DPP is an ideal alternative to the pioneering YMCA-based DPP and has the potential to revolutionize the delivery of diabetes prevention programs. Omada Health has assembled an impressive team of collaborators to support and enhance their efforts, including: Martha Funnell, MS, a prominent diabetes educatory and past-chair of the National Diabetes Education Program; Anne Peters, MD, a renowned dialectologist and head of the USC Clinical Diabetes Program; Mark Berman, MD, an internal medicine physician with a focus on lifestyle medicine; Chip Heath, PhD, Professor of Organizational Behavior at Stanford University, an expert in behavior modification; and Willem Van Lancker, a Lead User Experience Designer at Google.

Abstract:	Depression and cardio-metabolic illnesses like diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are leading health and economic burdens in India and globally. Depression and diabetes commonly co-exist, adversely interact, and compound the risks of disabling complications, reduced quality of life, and mortality when they are poorly controlled. Depression affects 20% of the 61 million people with diabetes in India, and data suggest that depression and CVD risk factors are under-treated in over 60% of people with diabetes. A number of patient-level (e.g., low adherence to treatments), provider-level (e.g., deficiencies in treatment intensification), and system-level (e.g., human resource constraints and lack of systems to manage chronic diseases) factors are commonly cited barriers to achieving better control of these conditions. Our team has shown that targeting both depression and diabetes control has important synergistic benefits (TEAMCare study). Since diabetes patients in India tend to access specialists (government or private) for their diabetes and other health care needs, they at least have a point of contact with the health system which can be leveraged to also improve depression care. Also, interventions for depression can be integrated into routine diabetes care delivery with only modest modifications. Our integrated multi-condition (depression and diabetes) intervention model merges experiences from TEAMCare and an ongoing trial of CVD risk reduction in India (CARRS Trial) and involves 1. enhancing the role of nurses and training them in disease management; 2. integrating "intelligent" technology; and 3. weekly physician oversight to review poorly controlled cases and make responsive treatment adjustments. We propose to take this model from research to practice using an implementation sciences approach. First, we will collect qualitative data regarding patients', families', and care providers' perceptions of disease, treatments, and barriers, and elicit feedback regarding the intervention's components. Second, we will culturally tailor our intervention materials for India. Third, in 360 diabetes patients with depressive symptoms and at least one poorly controlled CVD risk factor, we will evaluate the sustained effectiveness, expenditures, and cost-utility of our integrated model compared to usual care (notifying patients' routine providers of their depressive symptoms and poor CVD risk factor control) in a single blind, randomized controlled implementation trial at three large diabetes clinics in India over 24 months. We hypothesize that 30% of intervention arm participants compared to 15% of usual care participants will achieve combined improvements (in depression score plus at least one CVD risk factor). Finally, we have arranged to work with the Public Health Foundation of India to develop sustainable post-trial scalability (e.g., certification) and dissemination activities. Our team of US and India investigators has specific expertise and experience, and five years of collaboration with colleagues in India, and is well poised to complete this work with high-quality outputs that could be beneficial for the estimated 12 million people with diabetes and depression in India.

Abstract:	For the nearly 75% of patients living with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who do not use insulin, decisions regarding self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is unclear. SMBG testing is a resource-intensive activity without firmly established patient benefits. While SMBG holds great promise for sparking favorable behavioral change, the potential for no benefit or even patient harm must be acknowledged. Possible negative effects on patient quality of life must be more closely examined along with the speculative benefits of SMBG in non-insulin-treated T2DM. Among studies examining this issue, a general consensus is evolving; while SMBG may or may not be clinically useful, its value can only be fully appreciated when the SMBG results are provided to patients in a useful manner. The overarching goal of this proposal is to assess the impact of three different SMBG testing approaches on patient-centered outcomes in patients with non-insulin-treated T2DM within the real-world, clinic setting. In this pragmatic trial, 450 patients will be randomized to one of the following three SMBG testing regimens: (1) no SMBG testing; (2) once daily SMBG testing with standard patient feedback consisting of glucose values being immediately reported to the patient through the glucose meter; and (3) once daily SMBG testing with enhanced patient feedback consisting of glucose values being immediately reported to the patient, plus automated, tailored feedback messaging following each SMBG testing event delivered to the patient through the glucose meter. The first two arms represent common SMBG testing approaches currently being used. The third arm is an enhanced, patient-centered approach to SMBG testing. SMBG values will be evaluated at routine clinic visits over 52 weeks. The following primary outcomes will be assessed: quality of life and glycemic control. We will assess differences across the following pre-specified subgroups: (1) prior experience using SMBG; (2) duration of T2DM; (3) baseline degree of glycemic control; (4) anti-hyperglycemic treatment; (5) age; (6) race/ethnicity; and (7) health literacy. Secondary outcomes will include diabetes-related treatment satisfaction, diabetes self-efficacy, diabetes distress, self-care, hypoglycemia frequency, and patient-provider communication. Using qualitative methods, we will assess health care providers' attitudes and experiences with using the automated system to deliver SMBG results within the real-world, busy clinic setting. Given the time- and resource-intensive nature of SMBG and the rapidly growing prevalence of T2DM, the practice of medicine is overdue for a pragmatic assessment of the utility of SMBG in everyday, routine clinical practice that evaluates outcomes of central importance to patients living with the disease.

Abstract:	Project background: American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have the highest prevalence of diabetes among all U.S. racial and ethnic groups. In fiscal year (FY) 2010, the diabetes prevalence among AI/AN adults who obtained services through Indian Health Service (IHS) was 14.6%, nearly double the U.S. rate. Compared to other racial groups, AI/ANs are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages and to have more diabetes-related complications. These factors substantially increase diabetes-related mortality. Although diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., it ranks fourth among AI/ANs. Heart disease is the leading cause of AI/AN mortality and a common complication among those with diabetes. AI/ANs have the highest rate of premature deaths from heart disease among all races; that is, they are more likely to die from heart disease before age 65 than other races. To address this need, IHS and tribes collaborated with the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health (CAIANH) to create a project data set from existing data sources, which are stored in different computer systems, to increase their capability to evaluate health services. We propose to use these data, and the collaborations we developed as part of the previous project, for this study. Project goal: The project goal is to provide information that may be used to improve health outcomes among AI/AN adults with diabetes and CVD. Project methods: The study population includes approximately 14,600 AI/AN adults with diabetes and CVD who use IHS services and lived in 15 project sites during FY2012. The data infrastructure includes data for FY2011-2012. Building on existing collaborations, we will create a Collaborative Network that includes CAIANH, IHS and tribal health program representatives, and patients to provide advice and guidance on all aspects of the study. Patients will provide input on all study activities. First, we will conduct analyses to better understand the patients' needs. These will include analyses of health status, service use, and treatment costs. Second, we will conduct a study to evaluate how use of education, case management, and advanced practice pharmacy services influences patient outcomes. The Collaborative Network will identify which patient outcomes should be studied. They may include health status outcomes based on clinical measures (e.g., blood pressure, glycemic, and cholesterol levels) and health care quality outcomes such as preventable use of inpatient services and hospital readmissions. Finally, the Collaborative Network will use these findings to identify strategies that may facilitate patients' ability to make informed choices about using education, case management, and advanced practice pharmacy services, and enhance the provision of these services to better address patients' needs.

Abstract:	Diabetes affects 25.6 million individuals in the US aged 21 years and older or 11.3% of this population. Diabetes causes high blood glucose which often results in serious health problems including blindness, heart disease, stroke, and amputations of the foot and toes. While diet and exercise can lower blood glucose, most individuals with diabetes need medications such as pills or insulin, proper diet and exercise, and at-home glucose testing. There are many factors which influence how well patients are able to comply with these requirements including age, education, income, and cultural and lifestyle issues. Often, the way an individual responds to treatment in terms of negative side effects and the burden of the treatment impacts compliance. In addition, persons with diabetes might also be depressed or have other diseases and conditions that make treatment with a particular medication or regimen more difficult. While diabetes patients act and respond differently to treatment due to many reasons, health care providers often cannot advise patients as to how they might respond given their personal characteristics simply because they do not have the required information. While drug research studies can tell us on average how effective a particular treatment will be in terms of lowering blood glucose, they cannot tell us how any one individual will respond. Moreover, while they can tell us how variable the response in blood glucose lowering is for different patients, they do not identify why patients respond differently. The reason for this is that typically no one clinical study can separate out the results by all the patient characteristics that might affect treatment. In addition, clinical drug trials have not typically measured how patients feel or how satisfied they are with their assigned treatment. In most clinical trials, the true voice of the patient is usually silent. During the past 25 years we have asked patients in clinical trials to tell us how they feel during their treatment. For our proposed research, we have combined the strengths of our pooled diabetes clinical trials quality-of-life database and one of the largest and most comprehensive health care electronic medical records databases in existence in an attempt to predict patient-centered characteristics that impact diabetes treatment effectiveness. The purpose of our study is compare the quality of life and treatment satisfaction responses to different therapies, and determine to what extent factors such as age, gender, employment status, education, income, race, language, ethnicity, clinical characteristics, and other conditions impact these responses. We will incorporate the results of our analysis into a web-based application that will allow clinicians to predict how likely a patient will be to respond given their individual characteristics and allow patients and physicians to benchmark their progress against others with similar characteristics to improve the quality of care.

Abstract:	Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) affects more than 5.5 million people with diabetes. People with painful DPN have trouble sleeping, participating in social events, and conducting daily activities such as going to the store. The following vignette describes the challenges of balancing treatment outcomes and burden in DPN: A 67-year-old woman with DPN is prescribed a tricyclic antidepressant after nearly eight months of persistent pain that interferes with her ability to sleep. Soon after starting treatment, she begins to experience dizziness that she believes is caused by her new drug and is considering stopping treatment. Several prescription medications are available for the treatment of DPN symptoms, but none work perfectly and all have side effects that may be difficult for some patients. When patients report their symptoms and side effects to their doctor, they provide the doctor with important information to help them make adjustments to treatment that will help with symptoms and that the patient can tolerate in terms of side effects. In some cases, doctors may encourage patients to make these changes on their own at home based on their experience with therapy. However, patients may have a long time between visits to their doctor and may have trouble describing their symptoms to their doctor during a brief 10 to 15 minute visit. This proposal will explore the possibility of computerized telephone calls to patients to gather information about treatment experiences that can then be reported to the doctor or used to guide patients to make changes in how they take the medication. It will address the following question: Can routinely asking patients about their experiences with medications and using that information to encourage clinically appropriate titration improve patient quality of life? We believe that asking patients about their experiences can encourage better communication between patients and doctors about treatment, as well as encourage treatment changes that improve patient outcomes.

Abstract:	It is easy to take your pancreas for granted. When you eat, your pancreas makes insulin, a hormone necessary for your cells to use sugar from food. For 175,000 children with type 1 diabetes (15,000 newly diagnosed annually), the pancreas doesn't make insulin, so sugar accumulates in the blood. Unlike type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented, cured, or treated solely with better diet and exercise. The only way for these children to survive is with multiple daily insulin injections. Not taking enough insulin can cause serious health problems, like kidney failure and blindness. Taking too much insulin can cause seizures or even death. Managing diabetes can reduce child and parent quality of life (QOL), negatively affecting school/work attendance and participation in activities. Diabetes care is also costly, ~$14.9 billion annually in the U.S. Although help is available, most families struggle to control their child's diabetes. Each family faces a different set of challenges in managing the disease. Taking a family-centered approach to diabetes management, in which resources are tailored to each family's unique challenges, could result in better health. Currently, there is no convenient way for providers to identify families' challenges in managing diabetes, so families are often referred to resources that don't address their needs. Families become frustrated and may not get the services needed to successfully manage diabetes. PRISM (Problem Recognition in Illness Self-Management), a 10-minute survey, can identify the best resources to help families, based on their specific needs. In preliminary testing, using PRISM to select resources resulted in substantial improvements in blood sugar control. This project's long-term goal is to provide families with the best help for managing diabetes, to improve blood sugar control and QOL. In partnership with parents, children, clinicians, clinic administrators, and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, this study will examine whether families who use PRISM to select resources to improve diabetes management will have better blood sugar control and child/parent QOL than families receiving usual care. About 200 children (8-16 years old) with diabetes and their parent(s) will be enrolled at two sites. Families who agree to participate will complete the PRISM and QOL surveys and have their child's A1c (blood sugar control) measured. Families will be randomly assigned to receive either resources that are matched to their needs by PRISM or their usual care (100 in each category). Resources will be delivered in group sessions scheduled to coincide with children's routine diabetes visits, making participation easier for families. Children's blood sugar control will be measured every 3-6 months while child/parent QOL will be measured every 6 months. If PRISM improves blood sugar or QOL, the tool could be incorporated into the care of all children with diabetes. More on this project: Video: Helping Families Manage Type 1 Diabetes in Adolescents.

Abstract:	Patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) helps patients and stakeholders make informed health care decisions, allowing their voices to be heard in assessing the value of health care options, but information on what patients and stakeholders value is often lacking. The values of patients and stakeholders can be identified by actively engaging them through consultation or by applying stated-preference methods to measure their priorities and preferences. Although both approaches are important, stated-preference methods have several advantages. They can incorporate both qualitative and quantitative methods and they can be used with large, diverse populations, including hard-to-reach patients and stakeholders. The validity, reliability, and generalizability of the findings of stated preference studies can be assessed. Finally, the preferences of different sub-groups can be compared and groups of individuals with similar preferences can be identified and described. Our proposal focuses on advancing and disseminating methods for patient and community engagement in PCOR and has three objectives. First, we will demonstrate good practices for patient and community involvement in PCOR projects by applying principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR). Second, we will address several key methodological questions pertaining to the use of stated-preference methods. As outlined in the specific aims, these include identifying the best methods for identifying patient priorities (aim 1), the best method for designing preference studies (aim 2), and strategies for analyzing variation in preferences (aim 3). We also seek to assess the relevance of stated-preference methods to patients and stakeholders (aim 4). Third, we will demonstrate good practices for applying stated-preference methods by studying the priorities and preferences of patients with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes was chosen because it is a chronic disease that requires meaningful patient involvement to improve outcomes. Type 2 diabetes affects 25.8 million people (8.3%) in the U.S. and disproportionately affects African American and Latino populations. While type 2 diabetes provides an important case study, our research will advance approaches and methods that will be broadly generalizable to other diseases, and to diverse patient and stakeholder groups. To facilitate the dissemination of our findings, we have engaged a local community board and a national diabetes advisory panel who will be engaged via regular meetings, a quarterly newsletter and a project website. Our dissemination plan will focus on the dissemination of lay explanations of our methods and results and document case studies of our patient/community engagement and application of stated-preference methods to type 2 diabetes.

Abstract:	Two recent randomized placebo-controlled trials show that gestational diabetes (GDM) treatment (vs. none) improves maternal and perinatal outcomes, based on diagnosis with a 2-step screening strategy. Also, a large multi-center prospective cohort study showed a linear relationship with glucose and maternal and perinatal outcomes, based on screening with a single 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Based on this large cohort's findings, the American Diabetes Association recommended that clinical practice adopt the 1-step 75g screening approach for diagnosing GDM. The American College of Obstetrics & Gynecology took the opposite stance, recommending the traditional 2-step screening because it alone has RCT outcome evidence. What is urgently needed in 2013 to best inform clinical practice and health policy is not an additional GDM treatment vs. control trial, but a pragmatic RCT testing the 2 recommended clinical strategies. To pragmatically address this critical research gap, we propose to randomize an estimated 17,626 diverse women to GDM screening (2-step vs. 75g OGTT) as part of their clinical care in the Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW) and Hawaii (KPH) regional health plans. We will use the plans' electronic medical record (EMR) system at the time of GDM screening to randomize the women. Both KPNW and KPH regions universally screen for GDM at 24-28 weeks gestation, and they will cover the costs of randomizing women to the two approaches, as well as treatment per standard protocol, as part of clinical care. Importantly, our team will also leverage the strong partnerships we forged with both regions' OB/GYN departments to carry out our current project that evaluates the Impact of Early Gestational Diabetes Screening in High-Risk Populations (R01 HD058015). By randomizing GDM screening in the context of clinical care, we specifically propose to compare GDM prevalences (aim 1) and differences in maternal and perinatal outcomes between screening strategies (aim 2). We also propose to determine the concordance of the 75g OGTT with GDM diagnosed by 2-step, among a recruited sub-sample of 1,000 pregnant women at KPNW and KPH. With our combined expertise in the GDM field and strong regional partnerships to support randomizing current universal GDM screening in KPNW and KPH as part of clinical care, we are exceptionally poised to fill the important research gap about these 2 screening strategies (2-step vs. 75g OGTT). Additionally, because of our KP health plan collaborations, we offer an extraordinary capacity to track and evaluate the impact of these screening strategies on outcomes in over 35,000 participants (>17,500 mother-child pairs). This proposal also offers the design advantage of testing aims in a "real-world" clinical setting. Results from our proposed pragmatic RCT truly have enormous potential to fundamentally and quickly transform clinical practice.

Abstract:	Diabetes is rising at an alarming rate in Canada. Without urgent preventative action, diabetes will continue to deteriorate the health status of the Canadian population and overwhelmingly burden the health care system. Health policy makers at all levels have authoritatively stated that diabetes prevention as a key priority through policy announcements and strategic system investments; however, there is uncertainty on the type, intensity, and target of health interventions that will achieve the most effective and efficient impact overall and in priority populations. Risk algorithms are tools that predict the future risk of a disease for an individual, and they have widespread use in clinical practice. To date, risk algorithms have rarely been applied to the population level to inform prevention strategies or public health practice. We have developed and validated the Diabetes Population Risk Tool (DPoRT), which estimates future diabetes risk based on routinely collected population data. This practical tool was specifically designed to be applied to the population level and has resulted in an innovative way to make routinely collected health data useful for informing diabetes prevention strategies and support local decision making and planning. To date, work to understand how best to integrate this tool into practice is lacking, thereby limiting the uptake. The goal of this study is to implement and evaluate an integrated knowledge translation strategy with local and provincial public health decision makers in two provinces to facilitate the application of this innovation. Overall, this research will identify strategies on how best to apply risk tools in practice in order to inform diabetes prevention across Canada. The results of this work will be useful to policymakers and public health officials interested in diabetes prevention, as well as lead to improvements in the integration of data into policy decisions.

Abstract:	The goal of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to understand the development of health communication competence in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and evaluate associations among health communication, self-care, and health outcomes in this population. AYAs with T1D are at high risk for negative health outcomes, including poor glycemic control, increased chronic complications, and poor quality of life. The deterioration of glycemic control occurs in parallel with the assumption of independent self-care skills, including responsibility for medical care. Effective communication between AYAs and health care providers may be a critical, yet understudied, contributor to self-care skills. The proposed longitudinal study plans to examine the development of health communication skills in 75 adolescents and young adults (ages 16-20) with T1D over an 18-month period and evaluate high-quality health communication as a predictor of diabetes self-care and health outcomes. The candidate's long-term goal is to develop and implement innovative preventive interventions to best prepare AYAs with chronic illnesses and their families for transition to independent self-care. Specific short-term training goals proposed for this award include 1) develop expertise in the assessment and evaluation of health communication in AYAs; 2) expand knowledge of pathophysiology of T1D; and 3) gain advanced behavioral science competencies, including advanced data analyses, clinical trial design, and grant writing. The research and training experiences proposed within this four-year K23 award will be conducted at Children's National Medical Center and Johns Hopkins University and are supported by an outstanding multidisciplinary team of mentors and advisors, including Dr. Randi Streisand (primary mentor), Dr. Pamela Hinds (co-mentor), and Dr. Kristin Riekert (co-mentor). This focused mentorship and training will position the candidate to become a successful independent investigator in behavioral diabetes research. Results from this study have the potential to greatly improve self-care skills and reduce negative health outcomes in AYAs with T1D. Equipping adolescents and young adults with skills to enhance health communication may hasten the development of vital self-advocacy skills needed for independent self-care and in the adult health care system and, thus, establish a lasting pattern of positive health interactions.

Abstract:	This application addresses the gap between the demonstrated efficacy of behavioral interventions for adults with diabetes and what is achievable in "real-world" clinical practice. We propose to integrate two efficacious adjuncts to routine diabetes care: 1) self-management interventions, targeting treatment adherence; and 2) cognitive behavioral skills approaches, aimed at reducing emotional distress, a common and under-recognized aspect of living with diabetes. If widely disseminated, these interventions have the potential for significant public health impact. Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a cost-conscious, comprehensive approach to improving diabetes outcomes. In partnership with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, we will deliver the intervention to eligible patients through an existing and sustainable program focused on the improvement of health outcomes for individuals with diabetes and other chronic illnesses. This program supports electronic medical record (EMR) systems development and quality improvements in participating practices throughout NYC. The program employs prevention outreach specialists to identify high-risk patients with gaps in care via EMR data and, in consultation with care providers, contact these patients via telephone to re-engage them with care. We will use this existing program to examine the following specific aims: 1) to conduct an effectiveness trial evaluating the impact of comprehensive telephonic self-management support (Tele-SMS) on HbA1c (primary outcome), distress, treatment adherence, lipids, and blood pressure (secondary outcomes); 2) to apply RE-AIM to evaluate dissemination and implementation and facilitate translation to other sites; and 3) to obtain information on the cost of implementing Tele-SMS relative to treatment benefits. Individuals receiving care at primary care practices will be randomly assigned to one of two arms, Tele-SMS or enhanced usual care. Tele-SMS will focus on problem solving for barriers to medication adherence, improving lifestyle behaviors, and communicating effectively with providers. Additionally, it will involve the use of specific communication strategies to enhance the expression and normalization of emotional distress and ambivalence and, for patients experiencing significant distress, will provide instruction and practice with cognitive behavioral skills. Further, a formalized process for information exchange with care providers will be implemented to address clinical inertia and encourage guideline-concordant care of diabetes and depression, when indicated. Enhanced usual care participants will receive routine care plus print self-management support materials. A total of 875 individuals with diabetes will provide 83% power to detect a significant difference (p<0.05) between groups of at least 0.5% in absolute HbA1c. A full RE-AIM evaluation will be conducted and intervention cost data will be evaluated for translation of findings and scalability. Results will inform public health policies and practices in New York City, as well as other urban areas throughout the nation and could make a significant step towards closing the translation gap in comprehensive diabetes care.

Abstract:	One in two people with diabetes in Australia do not receive adequate screening or follow-up for diabetic retinopathy, a leading complication of diabetes and cause of vision loss and blindness. To tackle this issue, a new Australian study will evaluate a new telephone intervention designed to inform people with diabetes about diabetic retinopathy screening. This intervention is expected to improve future adherence to national screening guidelines for diabetic retinopathy.

Abstract:	Background: The co-occurrence of diabetes and depressive symptoms is highly prevalent and has dramatic consequences on the quality of life and health of affected patients. Due to the complex interrelation between these conditions, patients often experience both psychological and physiological difficulties. Furthermore, veterans with diabetes and depressive symptoms in rural settings have limited access to care. Interventions that reach veterans in rural/community-based primary care are needed, especially those that blend treatment strategies for physical and emotional health. Objectives: The specific objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the Healthy Outcomes through Patient Empowerment (HOPE) intervention to enhanced usual care (EUC) on diabetes (HbA1c) and depression (PHQ-9) outcomes at 6 and 12 month follow-up. The exploratory aims of the project included 1) the examination of the role of moderators and mediators on intervention effectiveness, 2) the evaluation of factors that mediate or moderate effectiveness at 6 and 12 months for patients enrolled in the HOPE intervention arm, and 3) the evaluation of the potential for embedding the HOPE intervention processes within a VA CBOC using the RE-AIM framework for evaluating effectiveness of behavioral interventions. Methods: The HOPE study is a randomized controlled trial. We enrolled 225 veterans from the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center and surrounding community-based outpatient clinics with uncontrolled diabetes and clinically significant depressive symptoms. One hundred thirty-six veterans were randomized to the HOPE intervention and 89 to enhanced usual care (EUC). Eligible veterans lived 20 miles or more from the tertiary center where they are treated or receive their primary care through one of the surrounding VA community-based clinics. Veterans had an HbA1c level above 7.5 in the last 12 months and achieved a score of 10 or greater on the PHQ-9 scale administered by the study staff. Veterans randomized to both groups received screening, education, and notification of clinical findings along with follow-up in usual primary care. Participants randomized to HOPE also received behavioral coaching telephone sessions over a six-month period. Coaches used a standardized, theory-based process for conducting the sessions with the aim of creating patient-centered and articulated goals and behavioral action plans. Hemoglobin A1c and PHQ-9 measurements along with self-report questionnaires were collected at baseline, and 6 and 12 months follow-up. Changes in measurements from baseline were compared between groups. Findings: The proposed hypotheses for the study were (1) that after 6 months (active treatment phase), HOPE will produce greater improvements in diabetes control (measured by hemoglobin A1c levels) and depression (measured by PHQ-9 scores) than will EUC; and (2) that at 12 months (6-month active phase plus 6-month maintenance phase), HOPE participants will continue to evidence significantly greater improvements in HbA1c and PHQ-9 compared with EUC participants. Preliminary analyses for the primary outcomes demonstrated small intervention effect sizes for change in depression (PHQ-9) of d=0.34 and diabetes-related QoL (PAID) of d=0.32; and no intervention effect for change in glycemic control (HbA1c) with d=0.06. PHQ-9 and HbA1c values did reach levels of minimally clinically significant change in the intervention group at 12-month follow-up (PHQ-9: from 15.8 +/- 4.2 to 10.1 +/- 6.9; HbA1c: 9.2 +/- 1.4 to 8.7 +/- 1.6); but these changes were not statistically significant compared to the usual care group in a time by treatment analyses: PHQ-9 (p=.10) and HbA1c (p=.74). In each main area assessed, veterans in the HOPE group had improvements in their depression symptoms (PHQ-9 change 5.7), glycemic control (A1c change 0.5), and diabetes distress (PAID change 17.4) but these changes were not statistically significant compared with the enhanced usual care group in our intent to treat analyses. We are proceeding with additional analyses to explore treatment dose effects and other "treatment as received" analyses to determine if certain patients experience greater treatment-related effects than others. Impact: The HOPE Project demonstrated modest benefits on depression symptoms and diabetes related QoL for veteran participants one year after enrollment. There was no treatment benefit at one-year follow-up for glycemic control (HbA1c). Furthermore, the changes from 6 to 12 months were stable or even improved in the intervention group compared to some regression among usual care participants for the main outcomes. The results of the study were not as robust as anticipated overall when comparing the HOPE intervention to enhanced usual care. Additional analyses are planned to identify characteristics of patients and potential dose-response effects that may be associated with higher likelihood of benefit from enrollment in the HOPE intervention. If present, the HOPE intervention could be targeted to this more selective at-risk population.

Abstract:	Background: Performance measures coupled with incentives have been viewed as critical components driving the VA quality transformation in the late 1990s. Measures related to control of intermediate outcomes among patients with diabetes have shown striking improvements over time which is laudable, but there are signs that this success comes at a cost. There are concerns that rates of overtreatment and other unintended consequences are increasing as a result of the pressure to meet increasingly stringent goals and benchmarks. To date, measures have been dichotomous; e.g., a patient's lab values meet the goal or not. The Diabetes QUERI has helped develop more meaningful "clinical action" measures that move away from dichotomous intermediate outcome measures that may drive some of the overtreatment. Other unintended consequences may result not only from overly stringent, dichotomous intermediate outcome performance measures but also from the way those measures are implemented or used (or misused) at the local facility. Objectives: The overarching goal of this project was to assess gaps and unintended consequences of implementing existing and the new diabetes-related performance measures in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in order to provide feedback to Office of Analytics and Business Intelligence (OABI) regarding ways to improve measurement construction and implementation of new performance measures. The specific study aims were 1) to understand consequences of diabetes performance measurement on providers and patients, particularly unintended consequences; 2) to explore how different local measurement implementation strategies affect consequences of diabetes performance measures; and 3) to explore new candidate performance measures to minimize unintended consequences such as overtreatment among patients with diabetes. Methods: This study was a phase three pre-implementation study to identify and understand unintended consequences and gaps in implementation of diabetes-related performance measures. We used a mixed-methods design. We will purposively select a sample of medical centers based on their performance (highest, lowest) with respect to three diabetes measures (BP, LDL, HbA1c) and prevalence of overtreating BP to maximize variation among study sites. To explore and categorize unintended consequences of performance measurement and the process of implementation, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) leadership, facility leadership, primary care providers, care managers, and other staff identified by these providers, who are involved in providing care to patients with diabetes. In addition, guided by information from our qualitative interviews and our expert clinical work group, we will identify potential measures of inappropriate overtreatment and specify the construction of these measures. Findings: We interviewed 59 leaders and staff from four VAMCs in four different VISNs and completed site visits at each facility. Aim one and aim two are to understand consequences of diabetes performance measurement on providers and patients, particularly unintended consequences, and to explore how different implementation strategies play a role in the manifestation of those consequences. We learned about several positive consequences of performance measures: 1) measures are often translated to clinical reminders, which help providers remember to address routine, preventive care with their patients; and 2) high-priority goals trigger quality improvement initiatives, such as introducing more Shared Medical Appointments, using clinical pharmacists to help manage complicated diabetes patients, and establishing integrated diabetes clinics. However, we also identified the following unintended consequences of performance measures. These issues must be interpreted within the larger trend of marked improvement within the VHA, which has in part been driven by performance measurement: 1. providers are disenfranchised from the development and implementation of performance measurement; and 2. performance measures are not well defined and are largely dichotomous. They are often translated directly to clinical reminders and conflated with treatment guidelines; 3. executive performance plans (EPPs) are changed every year, but are not published until well into the fiscal year. Related performance measures and goals are not adequately communicated to providers; very few providers or leaders know about the newest VA/DoD diabetes treatment guidelines. This problem is exacerbated by high executive-level turn-over; 4. primary care providers shoulder a disproportionate share of the burden to meet performance goals; 5. executive leadership and providers struggle with the vast number of measures they need to monitor. Many providers feel that the large number of clinical reminders degrades the provider-patient relationship; 6. the linkage between performance measures and performance-based pay is tenuous and misunderstood, and does not serve to motivate providers to meet measures; 7. EPRP data is increasingly inadequate and problematic as more facilities engage in "provider profiling"; and 8. providers only receive negative feedback on performance goals via lists of patients who "fell out" on a measure. This causes angst and cognitive dissonance; providers believe they provide quality care to complex patients, yet they only receive feedback on their failure to meet performance measures. Aim three: Our analyses have revealed that increased age, greater health care use, and co-morbidity, as well as external changes in policies affecting treatment guidelines, contribute to overtreatment. Several events related to LDL-related treatment guidelines have provided the opportunity to assess treatment in response to these key events. June 2011 saw the highest percentage of patients (72%) with LDL < 100, the "traditional" performance measure goal. However, in that same month, the FDA issued a recommendation limiting the use of the highest approved dose of the cholesterol-lowering medication simvastatin (80 mg) because of increased risk of muscle damage. One year later, the Clinical Analysis Reporting (CAR), Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA) announced a forthcoming revised measure where lipid control would be deemed appropriate if "the patient is receiving at least a moderate dose of a statin drug or LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) value is 100 or less." Four months later in October 2012, a National Clinical Reminder was released. By November 2012, the percentage of patients with LDL < 100 dropped to 69%. In this same time period, the percentage of patients on a high-dose statin decreased by approximately 5%. Impact: Findings from this study will be translated into specific recommendations for our partners in OABI: 1) modifications to existing measures as well as suggestions for new measures, so that intended consequences are maximized and unintended consequences are minimized; 2) development of measures that track overtreatment to balance measures that address undertreatment; and 3) multi-level implementation strategies that can be used in the field. Our findings will provide needed information to guide development of a bundled set of strategies to enhance implementation of new measures, setting the stage for a future SDP to evaluate how improvements in both implementation strategies and performance measurement affect quality of care for patients with diabetes. Performance measurement plays a prominent role in VHA. These types of improvements in measuring and implementing performance will ultimately improve patient safety and quality of care.

Abstract:	Randomized trials have clearly shown that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) substantially reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes, particularly in those with albuminuria. Even so, these medications are currently under-prescribed across the United States. For example, in the northeastern VA (Veterans Affairs) hospital system, only 67% of the 52,174 patients with diabetes currently receive at least one of these medications. Innovation: Interactive spaced education (ISE) is a novel educational methodology based on the "spacing effect," the psychological finding that repeated presentations of educational material over spaced intervals increase learning efficiency and improve knowledge retention. ISE is delivered using periodic emails that contain clinical case scenarios and multiple-choice questions. We recently completed a randomized trial involving 95 primary care providers, which demonstrated that an ISE intervention on prostate cancer screening can generate a 40% relative reduction in inappropriate screening for over a year after the intervention. Specific aims: We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine whether ISE directed to VA primary care providers can increase the proportion of patients with diabetes who are: (1) treated with an ACEI or ARB and (2) screened for albuminuria (an absolute indication for ACEI or ARB use). Approach: One-hundred six of the 260 primary care practitioners (physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) in the northeastern VA hospital system will be recruited via email to participate in the study. Participants will be randomized to one of two cohorts: (1) the intervention cohort will receive the ISE intervention over approximately 1 year (7-12 months) and (2) the control cohort will receive the identical educational content as an email link and as a PDF file that can be accessed via an icon on their computer desktops during months 1-12. The ISE intervention will consist of a weekly email containing 1-2 multiple-choice questions based on a curriculum that supports ACEI/ARB use. Providers will submit answers to the questions online and immediately receive the correct answer and an explanation of the pertinent clinical issues. Using a new adaptive methodology, the spacing and content of the ISE intervention will be individualized for each clinician based on their performance. Both cohorts will complete a test at baseline and at 12 months to assess gains in knowledge. ACEI/ARB use among patients followed by participating clinicians will be assessed over 2 years: initial changes attributable to the ISE intervention will be identified in year 1, while the retention of these changes will be monitored in year 2. Anticipated impacts on health care: This study aims to demonstrate that online interactive spaced education (ISE) can improve primary care providers' care of their patients with diabetes. With content tailored to meet specific needs, ISE is the type of intervention that can be deployed across US health care systems to improve health care quality and clinical outcomes.

Abstract:	Rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have grown significantly in the last decade. Older adults, especially older adult ethnic minorities, are exceptionally vulnerable to diabetes, and many experience difficulties adhering to self-management recommendations related to diet, exercise, glucose testing, and medication. The proposed 36-month study investigates the subjective construction of diabetes among male and female African American and non-Hispanic white older adults, age 50 and over, with T2DM, living in Baltimore City (n=80). Using the McGill Illness Narrative Interview (MINI), a semi-structured ethnographic interview guide, we will explore participants' perceptions of their diabetes and their understandings of diabetes management. This study takes an innovative approach to diabetes understanding and management as it employs a social constructionist perspective; that is, this study seeks to identify what people themselves think about their diabetes and how local, social, cultural, and material contexts inform participants' conceptions of their diabetes and their approach to managing their illness. This study is also unique as the sample will be drawn from NIH's intramural Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Lifespan Study (HANDLS), a community-based, fixed-cohort, epidemiological study (n=3722) of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease risk in Baltimore. By obtaining our sample from the community-based HANDLS study, we will be able to capture persons who normally may not be included in a clinic-based study, i.e., persons not seeking treatment for their diabetes. We will employ code-based and case-based analytic strategies in order to examine how diabetes understandings, management, and social contexts vary across and within race and gender categories and with respect to diabetes duration and control. We argue that greater understanding of this subjective experience of diabetes is needed in order to more effectively help patients to negotiate the beliefs and contexts that play a role in self-management. Public health relevance: The prevalence of diabetes continues to increase at epidemic proportions, while adherence to self-management programs remains challenging, especially for older adults in urban contexts. This study of older adults' subjective understandings of their diabetes will provide rich, detailed insight into the construction of diabetes and diabetes management among older adult urban residents and the ethnic and gender variation in these constructions. This study will offer health care providers a better understanding of the ways in which subjective beliefs and experiences must be taken into account when working conjointly with patients to develop self-management plans.

Abstract:	The majority of health care utilization decisions in the US are made by the ~27% of Americans with multiple chronic conditions, comprising 66% of all health care spending. Overall, it is increasingly recognized that existing public reports of health care provider quality do not support decision making for these persons. In particular, reports for persons with diabetes may be misleading, as the large majority of persons with diabetes have at least one other chronic condition and most have several other conditions that may influence decisions about treatment priorities or alter the goals of care. Our primary goal is to examine and ultimately support improvement in the use of public reports of provider quality by persons with diabetes and multiple chronic conditions. Specifically, our aims include: (1) define and determine the prevalence of distinct clusters of persons with diabetes who have similar patterns of chronic conditions, (2) examine whether diabetes quality metrics meet minimum sample size requirements after stratifying by condition cluster and explore resulting variation in provider performance, (3) explore the extent of care fragmentation for persons with diabetes focusing on the extent to which care is dispersed among primary and specialty providers and clinics after stratifying by condition cluster, and (4) obtain consumer feedback on the usefulness of stratifying diabetes quality metrics and visits to specialists by condition cluster. We partner with the Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality, a consortium of provider groups that is a national leader in the public reporting on ambulatory care. For aims 1-3, three multi-specialty provider groups participating in the Collaborative will provide data from their electronic health records, for a total of ~52,000 persons with diabetes. In an innovative approach, we will use latent class analysis to identify distinct clusters of persons with similar patterns of chronic conditions, then use these condition clusters to create subgroups of individuals with similar chronic conditions and examine (within these subgroups) performance on diabetes quality metrics and the extent to which care is dispersed among primary and specialty care providers and clinics. We will also develop interactive web pages to display diabetes quality metrics and visits to specialists for each individual user according to their cluster of conditions, building of the Collaborative's consumer web site. Finally, we conduct cognitive interviews with ~20 persons with diabetes or persons who care for someone with diabetes to obtain consumer feedback on the usefulness and added value of this information. Major advantages of the proposed study include a direct tie between our research and a nationally recognized dissemination partner with whom we have previous successful partnership activities, the acquisition of data from a broad range of diverse primary care clinics across the state of Wisconsin, use of a set of well-established definitions for diabetes quality, and use of both quantitative and qualitative research approaches. The proposed research will provide information essential to understanding how to improve public reports on provider quality for persons with multiple chronic conditions. Public health relevance: The majority of health care utilization decisions in the US are made by persons with multiple chronic conditions. It is increasingly recognized that existing public reports of health care provider quality do not support decision making for these persons. Our long-term goal is to examine and ultimately support improvement in the use of public reports of provider quality by persons with diabetes and other chronic conditions. To achieve this goal, we examine whether reports on a provider's quality of diabetes care can be personalized by presenting information on groups of individuals with similar chronic conditions and whether persons with diabetes perceive added value in this information.

Abstract:	A growing body of research indicates that alcohol consumption may affect diabetes self-management and control, yet this association has not been examined in relation to ethnicity. This is an important area of study because there are significant ethnic differences in drinking practices between whites, blacks, and Hispanics, which may impact diabetic management practices. Diabetes disproportionately affects blacks and Hispanics relative to non-Hispanic whites, in terms of its prevalence and its associated morbidity and mortality. In order to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease, a thorough understanding of factors associated with its optimal management and control is required. Unfortunately, previous research on the association between alcohol consumption and poor adherence to self-care activities has not thoroughly characterized drinking. Consumption in these studies is limited to volume measures, which are divided into drinking categories that vary between studies making the comparison of results challenging. This submission proposes in aim 1 to describe and compare the drinking practices (abstention, volume [drinks/week], heavy drinking [> 2 drinks/day for men and > 1 drink/day for women], and binge drinking [at least 5 drinks per occasion for men and at least 4 drinks for women]) of those with diagnosed diabetes in relation to ethnicity and health status (insulin dependence, the duration of diabetes, co-occurring medical conditions, and perceived health status), while controlling for the effects of known correlates of drinking practices (age, sex, socioeconomic status, employment, and marital status). In addition, aim 2 will characterize adherence to 7 diabetic self-care activities of black, white, and Hispanic diabetics and to determine how these activities vary in relation to drinking practices, ethnicity, and other covariates. The practices to be examined include 1) daily glucose self-monitoring, 2) at least one hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test in the previous year, 3) a dilated eye examination in the previous year, 4) an examination of feet by a health professional in the previous year, 5) at least weekly self-examination of feet, 6) annual dyslipidemia screening, and 7) ever having visited a diabetes educator. Finally, aim 3 will test a partial mediation model, which proposes that optimal diabetes self-care results from several factors, including socioeconomic status, health care access, social support, health status, and drinking practices. Importantly, the model postulates that self-care is not directly affected by ethnicity, but rather ethnicity affects other factors, namely alcohol consumption, which directly impact self-care activities. Public health relevance: The proposed study may identify a significant, but modifiable barrier to diabetes self-management and control. Our findings may impact clinical practice by alerting health professionals about the importance of assessing patients' drinking practices and addressing how these practices impact diabetes self-management activities and glucose control.

Abstract:	Remarkably little is known about protective factors that reduce African Americans' risk for depression and diabetes comorbidity. In particular, the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans has never been demonstrated with a nationally representative sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences. The lack of research on depression and diabetes comorbidity research among African Americans is due primarily to rather small samples of black Americans in available data sets from which to draw meaningful conclusions. The proposed research plan aims to provide a comprehensive examination of whether socioeconomic status (SES) and known risk and protective factors are correlated with reductions in the risk for comorbid depression and diabetes with special attention to low-income populations in a nationally representative sample of 5,191 African Americans and Caribbean blacks. The public health significance lies in specifying which demographic factors related to lower comorbidity risk, which will inform subsequent health social service prevention interventions and strategies. The present study plan is designed to advance knowledge and make five important contributions to the literature on depression and diabetes comorbidity among African Americans, namely by (1) capitalizing on the strengths of a large, nationally representative data set, the National Survey of American Life (NSAL); (2) determining whether SES is associated with reductions in the risk for the studied comorbid condition by blacks; (3) examining the mediation effects of health insurance status on the relationship between SES and comorbid depression and diabetes conditions; (4) investigating the relative effects of comorbid status on employment outcomes for welfare recipients; and (5) describing the cultural meaning of being diagnosed with and managing health care with a comorbid diagnosis. The data analytic approaches to be used include logistic regression, multi-nominal logistic regression, and qualitative theme analyses techniques. Project narrative: Comorbid depression and diabetes is recognized as a condition that is costly to the health care system and is a vital topic of public health concern. Remarkably, few investigations focus on the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans with this comorbid condition. Moreover, no studies have demonstrated variable linkages with a nationally representative African American sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences until this one. The Surgeon General's report (2001), "Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity--A supplement to mental health," highlighted understanding the protective and risk factors for comorbid conditions among blacks as an emergent public health research priority.

Abstract:	Current guidelines recommend that patients with diabetes receive influenza vaccination every year. Since vaccination is already recommended for elderly (over 65) adults, these guidelines effectively single out non-elderly diabetic adults for vaccination. Despite these guidelines, vaccination rates remain below national goals. More importantly, the guidelines themselves assume that patients with diabetes develop influenza more frequently, or have more severe complications after influenza, compared to those without diabetes. The evidence currently available to support these claims is weak. We will perform three studies using population-based health records in Manitoba. First, we will examine the factors affecting whether patients with diabetes get vaccinated. Second, we will determine whether patients with diabetes are more likely to present with influenza than patients without diabetes. Third, among people who have an influenza-like illness, we will compare the rates of hospitalization and death in those who have diabetes and those who do not. The second and third questions will help us to understand whether patients with diabetes should truly be a "high risk" group for vaccination. If the risk is not greater in younger adults with diabetes, substantial resources may be spent improving vaccination rates among these patients when they could be better spent on other priority groups. In addition to contributing to our knowledge of diabetes and influenza, these studies will help determine if and how current vaccination programs should be improved.

Abstract:	This resubmission of a R21 research study will assess how different practices approach implementation of the chronic care model for depression and diabetes with the ultimate goal of developing a toolkit to facilitate implementation. We will relate implementation core components (such as training and coaching activities undertaken by the practices) to patient outcomes (namely, depression improvement in symptoms and blood glucose control). Questions we seek to address include: How can implementation processes be improved? Can implementation processes be "tailored" to practice? The specific aims of this proposal to be carried out in real-world practices are (1) to assess and compare implementation approaches of the chronic care model across practices mixing both quantitative and qualitative methods; (2) to evaluate the relationship between implementation core components and patient outcomes (depression improvement in symptoms and blood glucose control); and (3) to develop an implementation tool kit so that implementation strategies can be tailored to the practices, enhancing sustainability of the chronic care model. We will recruit 30 primary care practices in southeastern Pennsylvania involved in the Pennsylvania Primary Care Coalition. With support of this proposal, we seek to describe the practice characteristics associated with implementation and practice change and to develop the components of a tailored approach to implementation based on practice characteristics. The proposed study will directly inform the translation of research to practice by building stakeholder knowledge into the implementation process. Our main patient-level outcomes are depression improvement in symptoms (using the nine-item depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) and blood glucose control (using HbA1c). Our goal is to study what implementation core components (facilitative administrative support, selection, pre-service training, coaching, staff evaluation, program evaluation, and system support) are adopted and by whom and to develop interventions that are adapted to the practice environment and sustainable. A major goal will be to develop an implementation tool kit consisting of a tailored approach to implementation that will culminate in the submission of an R01 implementation grant. A tailored intervention is more likely to become institutionalized into the routine of the practice than an intervention that imposes upon the practice tools and approaches that were developed elsewhere. If this proposal is funded, we have an opportunity to capitalize on the momentum for innovation in primary care to help close the gap between effectiveness and implementation. The research proposed is consistent with NIMH priorities and directly relevant to objective 4 in the NIMH Strategic Plan, namely, "to help close the gap between the development of new, research-tested interventions and their widespread use by those most in need." This project can have a significant public health impact because efficacious interventions do not improve patient outcomes without good implementation; both are needed.

Abstract:	Parents are increasingly involved in their children's medical care. Parents participate in care routines, coordinate services, and make treatment decisions. This participation is consistent with the idea of family-centered care. Research recognizes that family-centered care is associated with higher satisfaction with care, as well as better parental and child emotional and social well-being. Family-centered care is also linked with increased responsibility and burden on parents. As much as parents often want to be involved, managing complex care routines in light of multiple other responsibilities is no easy task. To develop true collaboration and partnership, a better understanding of family-centered care that carefully captures the experiences of both parent caregivers and health care providers is crucial. In this study, I plan to conduct interviews with parents and health care providers caring for children with diabetes. More specifically, I will explore how the current emphasis on parental involvement and partnership in health care is understood and experienced by parent caregivers and health care providers and how it impacts their care work and relations with one another. Childhood diabetes is of interest because it is one of the most common childhood chronic illnesses and requires an adoption of intensive nursing routine and frequent interactions between parents and health care providers. Given the increasing number of children with a chronic health condition and the growing number of parents involved in home-based health care work, knowledge and understanding of health care delivered in a family-centered manner has important implications for developing best practices in health care and social services, and in turn improving the health and quality of life of parent caregivers and their children.

Abstract:	Diabetes distress (DD) refers to the unique emotional burdens, worries, and concerns that are part of the spectrum of patient experience when managing a severe, demanding chronic disease like diabetes. High DD is very common and persistent over time among those with diabetes, and it has been significantly associated with poor glycemic control, poor self-care, low diabetes self-efficacy, and poor quality of life, even after controlling for clinical depression. The vast majority of research in DD has focused on adults with type 2 diabetes, a metabolic disease based on genetic predisposition, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and insulin resistance. Far less research has focused on the very different experiences of DD among adults with type 1 diabetes: an autoimmune disease that requires much more intensive and intrusive management than type 2. The proposed research addresses two major gaps in the clinical care of adult patients with type 1 diabetes and DD: to develop a practical, reliable, and valid measure of DD for adult patients with type 1 diabetes, with empirically defined cut-points for high DD; and to test a unique, pragmatic, theory-based program to reduce high DD among at-risk, poorly controlled type 1 adults. Following a brief measurement study to establish reliable cut points for high DD, we propose a 2-arm clinical trial to test the comparative effectiveness of an adaptation of problem solving therapy, which now includes a comprehensive focus on emotion, behavior, and cognition, with a current standard of care--enhanced diabetes education. Primary outcomes are reduced DD and improved glycemic control. The innovative intervention uses a variety of modalities, some based on electronic and social media (e.g., real time web-based group calls, web-based blogging, personal telephone contact) to enhance participation and retention and reduce patient burden. We will also assess the impact of selective mediating and moderating variables, collect measures of cost, and link the findings to dissemination and implementation using RE-AIM (Reach, Efficacy/Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance). Public health relevance: The proposed project will develop and test an intervention to reduce high DD among adults with type 1 diabetes. In contrast to the educational and narrow cognitive frameworks currently in use, this already piloted, innovative, evidenced-based program is practical, generalizable, and patient-sensitive, resulting in a substantive public health impact.

Abstract:	Background: Type 2 diabetes is a preventable disease. Multiple large-scale randomized controlled trials have shown that in people with impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes can be prevented with lifestyle interventions that emphasize diet, exercise, and weight loss. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) showed that lifestyle interventions can reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 58% in this high risk group. Little is known about the incidence of pre-diabetes in the VA because routine screening for pre-diabetes is not an established practice. With a few exceptions, lifestyle modification interventions that target individuals with pre-diabetes and follow the Diabetes Prevention Program curriculum are not available to veterans in the VA. In order to address this gap in evidence-based clinical services, the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP) has funded a VA Diabetes Prevention Program Demonstration Project (VA DPP) at three VA medical centers (Baltimore, Minneapolis, and Greater Los Angeles). NCP has requested assistance to conduct a more extensive implementation focused evaluation of VA DPP. Objectives: The objectives are 1) to identify baseline participant demographic characteristics; attitudes and beliefs about diet, exercise and weight loss; psychosocial constructs such as social support; and self-regulation skills that predict 6-month weight loss and program attendance; and 2) to collect baseline survey data on hypothesized modifiable mediators of program impact on weight loss including outcome expectations, self-regulation, skill mastery, willingness to self-monitor, and self-efficacy for use in subsequent analyses after 12-month survey data, and to collect quality of life data to be used in future cost-effectiveness studies. Methods: Baseline survey data was collected from veterans eligible for the VA DPP from three medical centers across the country. All participants referred to the VA MOVE! program between August 2012 and December 2013 were evaluated for VA DPP eligibility and scheduled for a VA MOVE! orientation meeting. VA DPP-eligible veterans were invited to complete the baseline survey after completing an informed consent process and signing a written informed consent document. Consented veterans were provided with a copy of the surveys and stamped return envelope addressed to the Ann Arbor VA coordinating center. Instructions on the survey included a URL link to an online survey that can be used by veterans who prefer to answer the survey online as opposed to taking the paper survey. The survey included a unique participant code that will be used to match survey data with clinical and administrative data by participant. Findings: A total of 1577 veterans were referred to MOVE! between August 2012 and December 2013 at three VA medical centers across the country and were screened for the VA DPP program. Among these, 378 veterans were screened and eligible, based on eligibility criteria which included a hemoglobin A1c value between 5.7 and 6.4, consistent with the CDC criteria for pre-diabetes; a travel time to the VA medical center within 60 minutes; and not currently taking anti-glycemic medication. A total of 275 veterans were assigned to the DPP program, and 103 were assigned to the MOVE! program. Baseline surveys were completed by 197 participants (53%). General demographics on the respondents include a mean age of 59.3 years (+8.9) and 86.8% were male. A total of 54.8% of respondents were white and 70.5% had attended some college or more. A total of 54.3% of survey respondents indicated good or better general health status and the mean number of comorbidities for respondents was 7.2 (+1.7). Of the one hundred and ninety-seven survey respondents, 89.9% said they were motivated to lose weight, 85.8% were motivated to exercise, and 87.3% were motivated to eat a healthy diet. To our knowledge this is the first study to examine the prevalence of pre-diabetes among veterans in multiple VA medical centers. The results of this project will contribute to the evidence base used by our partners at the VA National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP) to develop and implement lifestyle interventions that reflect the needs of veterans. When baseline characteristics are examined with outcome measures at 12 months, the effectiveness of the VA DPP program will be further evaluated and characteristics that influence uptake of the program can be assessed. Our goal is to identify components of VA DPP that are not currently used in VA MOVE! and that enhance effectiveness. If the VA DPP is more effective than VA MOVE! for pre-diabetic veterans, then NCP will incorporate these results into a national rollout of the program. Impact: The data obtained from VA Diabetes Prevention Program Demonstration Project (VA DPP) suggests that large-scale implementation of the Diabetes Prevention Program in the VA could yield significant population-level benefits. In collaboration with our Operations partners, this project is helping the VA to identify the prevalence of pre-diabetes among the veteran population and determine the effect of lifestyle modification programs on diabetes prevention. This study collected baseline survey data from three medical centers on VA DPP participants and VA DPP-eligible VA MOVE! participants and identified baseline participant demographic characteristics; attitudes and beliefs about diet, exercise and weight loss, and psychosocial constructs such as social support; and self-regulation skills that predict weight loss and program attendance. The data collected has provided us with an insight into pre-diabetic veterans' attitudes and beliefs about diet, exercise, and weight loss, to our understanding of how different programs may impact weight loss, and to evidence-based targeting in future clinical implementation projects. It will also provide baseline quality-of-life data for use in a future cost-effectiveness analysis.

Abstract:	Despite many new medications and technologies to improve diabetes self-management and glycemic control (blood glucose [BG] levels), disability and premature mortality from chronic diabetes complications remain common, highlighting the gap between treatment advances and robust patient uptake. Non-adherence to prescribed diabetes treatment contributes significantly to this gap, especially in the vulnerable population of mid to older teens with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who are emerging from their parents' care and becoming more independent in their own self-care. During this developmental period, glycemic control often deteriorates as adherence to BG monitoring declines. Longitudinal studies reveal that non-adherence in late adolescence is a risk factor for poor glycemic control, multiple physical and psychiatric comorbidities, and premature mortality. The primary aim of the proposed project is to improve glycemic control, measured as hemoglobin A1c (A1c) (an index of average BG levels over the previous 2-3 months), by motivating self-care behaviors in mid to older teens with T1D, ages 14-17 years old. Given the complex and often intractable nature of non-adherence in adolescence, this application proposes to design, implement, and evaluate multi-faceted interventions aimed at increasing adherence, particularly to BG monitoring, and improving glycemic control. These interventions include (1) a behavioral teen work (TW) intervention targeting BG monitoring and diabetes self-management through increased self-efficacy, (2) automated 2-way text message reminders to check BG levels (TX), or (3) both (TW/TX). The proposed project extends our Family Teamwork intervention, previously validated in school-age children and young teens with T1D, by tailoring it to mid to older teens with T1D, and also builds on our pilot work of 2-way text message reminders to increase BG monitoring frequency. The Teen work intervention is focused on self-care behaviors and is integrated into the teen's regular quarterly diabetes clinic visits. Grounded in social cognitive theory, this multiple-PI R01 randomized controlled clinical trial will be implemented at two large diabetes clinical sites. We propose a 2x2 factorial design in which 300 mid to older teens with T1D duration of e1 year and A1c levels of 7-13% will be randomized to 1 of 4 groups: TW, TX, TW/TX, or standard care (SC). In this 2-year study, the primary outcome will be change in A1c from baseline to 12 months across the 4 groups, as well as from 12 to 24 months. To ensure recruitment and retention of this at-risk population, the SC group will cross-over to TW/TX at 12 months. The TW, TX, and TW/TX groups will continue to receive their respective interventions in months 12-24 to assess durability. We will assess BG monitoring frequency and A1C, as well as other measures for mode rational and meditational analyses. Data will be collected on costs of the interventions and any adverse outcomes to assess if the interventions enhance adherence to BG monitoring and improve A1c cost-effectively in mid to older teens with T1D as they prepare to transition to young adulthood and diabetes self-care. Public health relevance: Increasing numbers of youth are developing type 1 diabetes, placing those affected at risk for vision loss, kidney failure, heart disease, and premature mortality as young and middle-aged adults due to the challenges of achieving optimal blood glucose control, especially during adolescence. Mid to older teens with type 1 diabetes are a particularly high-risk population, as their glycolic control (blood glucose levels) often deteriorates as they prepare to transition from their parents' care to more independent diabetes self-care and to transition from pediatric to adult health care systems. This project will implement and evaluate a behavioral intervention called Teen work, with or without the addition of text message reminders to check blood glucose levels, in mid to older teens with type 1 diabetes in order to increase adherence to blood glucose monitoring, improve glycolic control, and prepare these youth for optimal independent self-care, thereby reducing both the personal burdens and high public health care costs of diabetes.

Abstract:	There is substantial evidence that overweight and obesity during late life (at least 65 years of age) confers significant risk for type 2 diabetes and comorbid conditions. Thus, there is growing concern about the public health consequences of increased incidence of type 2 diabetes in an aging US population. Studies with high risk samples have shown that lifestyle interventions significantly reduce diabetes risk and that elders are particularly responsive, showing better weight loss and lower rates of diabetes development in comparison to younger individuals. However, although there have been program dissemination studies with mixed-age adult cohorts, few studies have focused specifically on persons at least 65 years of age or addressed the challenges of identifying workable platforms for delivering prevention programs to older adults. This application is based on the premise that offering an evidence-based lifestyle intervention to reduce risk for type 2 diabetes to retirees during the annual Medicare enrollment process presents an innovative, practical opportunity to reach eligible, high-risk adults. If shown to be feasible and effective, this program has strong potential for public health impact and medical cost-containment. Further, although clinical studies have emphasized the importance of continued contact over time in helping individuals to extend the benefits of lifestyle interventions, there are no dissemination studies of which we are aware that have systematically documented the impact of continued monthly contacts after the initial intervention period. Thus, the overall aims of this application are to 1. examine the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing the Group Lifestyle Balance 12-session program (GLB-12), an evidence-supported prevention program to mitigate diabetes risk, as part of the Medicare benefit offered to high risk retirees at a large public university; and 2. evaluate the utility of continued telephone contact in enhancing treatment outcome over a 24-month period. Eligible participants will be 320 non-diabetic adults, aged 65-80, with a BMI at least 27 and at least one additional cardio-metabolic risk factor. All participants will receive the GLB-12 and will then be randomized to one of two continued-contact protocols for the remaining one year of intervention, 10 sessions of continued small group contact by telephone (GLB-12 plus 10TC), or a newsletter control condition (GLB-12 plus NC). Program feasibility will be assessed by reporting enrollment, adherence and session completion rates, and satisfaction ratings in this delivery context. Effectiveness of the GLB-12 will be documented by reporting the proportion of participants meeting at least a 5% weight loss, a commonly accepted benchmark in translation studies known to be associated with favorable cardio-metabolic outcomes at month 4. It is also hypothesized that GLB-12 plus 10TC, when compared to GLB-12 plus NC, will be associated with more favorable anthropometric (weight, waist), cardio-metabolic (glucose, blood pressure, lipid), physical function (grip strength, balance, gait speed), and health-related quality-of-life outcomes at months 12 and 24. Finally, exploratory analyses will document program costs and program impact on medical utilization. Public health relevance: We propose to disseminate a novel, yet practical, diabetes prevention program among Medicare eligible adults. This study will provide 4-, 12-, and 24-month data to help determine whether a continued contact telephone intervention is feasible and effective in enhancing health outcomes and physical functional ability in adults aged 65-80.

Abstract:	As the prevalence of obesity in the United States has risen, so too has the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, a disease typically associated with adults. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has recommended screening children 10 years of age or older who are at substantial risk for the presence or development of type 2 diabetes. They also recommend that primary prevention efforts, such as lifestyle modification, be directed to high-risk children whose glucose levels are elevated but not yet diagnostic of diabetes. The choice of screening methodology remains controversial, and implementation within the pediatric primary care setting is far from ideal. The purpose of this study is to implement the ADA screening guidelines for type 2 diabetes within pediatric primary care practices using a computer decision support system (CDSS) developed by our research group--the Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation (CHICA) system. Using the CHICA system, we will also be implementing clinical management prompts for the pediatrician caring for children with risk factors for type 2 diabetes, with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), or with fasting glucose indicating the possibility of diabetes. One of the greatest strengths of the CHICA system is its ability to implement evidence-based recommendations from authoritative sources, in this case the ADA, in a format that integrates easily into routine pediatric care; the system can therefore overcome many of the barriers described by pediatricians to the screening of type 2 diabetes in children. While the use of CDSS is not new, its application within the pediatric population has not been as pervasive as in adult medicine. Moreover, the application of CDSS to the screening, diagnosis, and management of type 2 diabetes in children is relatively unexplored. The specific aims for this study are to (1) expand and modify an existing computer-based decision support system (CHICA) to identify those children 10 years of age or older who are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes, to provide pediatric physicians guidelines to screen for type 2 diabetes, and to coordinate the diagnosis and long-term management of the condition; and (2) demonstrate both the feasibility and effectiveness of the CHICA Type 2 Diabetes Module to recognize those children in need of screening for type 2 diabetes and facilitate prompt diagnosis and management of the condition. Phase one (aim 1) focuses on programming and enhancements to the CHICA system and will take 12 months to complete. Phase two consists of a randomized controlled trial conducted in four pediatric clinics in order to evaluate aim 2. Randomization will be by clinic, and we hypothesize that the coupling of CDSS with ADA guidelines will result in greater compliance with ADA recommended screening procedures as well as better clinical management of children identified as having pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes. Phase two will begin in year 2 and continue through quarter 2 of year 4. Phase three involves statistical analysis and manuscript preparation.

Abstract:	Many new drugs are appearing on the market to treat common chronic diseases such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. In the pre-market stage, new drugs are often tested on small, unrepresentative samples of patients. As a result, the effects of these drugs on people of different ethnicities and gender, as well as people with different clinical conditions, are often unknown. Post-market surveillance of new drugs is therefore important in order to monitor their safety and effectiveness after they enter the market. Voluntary reporting is one of the most common methods of post-market surveillance, but this method is insufficient, as it only captures 2-10% of adverse drug events (ADE). This indicates the need for improved methods of post-market surveillance. In recent years, there has been a call to explore ways in which electronic health records (EHR) could be used for post-market surveillance of new drugs. EHRs are valuable resources because they contain rich, clinical information on prescribed therapies, medical diagnoses, and lifestyle factors that is updated in real time. EHRs could therefore be used to create a real-time surveillance system that identifies large cohorts of people taking different drugs and monitors them for important clinical outcomes. This would allow researchers to assess the safety and effectiveness of new drugs in a timely fashion and compare available drug therapies on the market. In this study, I will be using EHRs from a real-time multi-national pharmacosurveillance system to assess the safety and effectiveness of different types of oral hypoglycemic drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes. This surveillance system will monitor millions of people in Canada, the USA, and England and allow for a robust analysis of the benefits and risks of different drug types. The results from this study will hopefully help physicians and patients improve the selection and use of oral hypoglycemic drugs and reduce the occurrence of ADEs.

Abstract:	Cancer and diabetes are two of the most common diseases in our society, and evidence shows that diabetes is associated with both a higher cancer risk and lower cancer survival. The reasons for these associations are still unclear. Most research has focused on the role of metabolic factors and diabetes drugs. However, few studies have looked at the role of health care factors such as cancer screening. Regular screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer has been shown to improve cancer survival. Diabetes may lead to lower cancer screening due to competing demands of diabetes care or other risk factors. These health care gaps increase the risk of more advanced cancer stage at diagnosis and higher cancer mortality in persons with diabetes. The goal of this study is to explore the influence of diabetes on the clinical steps leading to cancer diagnosis, by examining 1) whether they have lower cancer screening, 2) the risk factors for lack of cancer screening, and 3) a higher cancer mortality and more advanced stage at diagnosis compared to persons without diabetes. This study will use the existing Ontario health care databases between 1994 and 2012 to compare outcomes between persons with and without diabetes eligible for screening. First, we will assess for differences in up-to-date screening rates for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer. Second, we will examine how provider, health system, and patient factors may lower cancer screening rates in patients with diabetes. Third, we will assess for differences in cancer mortality and stage of breast and colorectal cancer. This research is important because the number of people living with diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions, and cancer is a leading cause of disability and death in our society. Addressing potential gaps in cancer screening in persons with diabetes will help to improve cancer care and outcomes for this population.
